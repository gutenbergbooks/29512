<h2 class="padtop">BOOK I.&mdash;SIENA</h2>



<h3 class="padtop">CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>&ldquo;I believe that Olive Agar is going to tell
you that she can&rsquo;t pay her bill,&rdquo; said the landlady&rsquo;s
daughter as she set the breakfast tray
down on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Gwen, how you do startle
one! Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She began again about the toast, and I
told her straight that you always set yourself
against any unnecessary cooking. Meat and
vegetables must be done, I said, but those
who can&rsquo;t relish bread as it comes from the
baker&rsquo;s, and plain boiled potatoes, can go
without, I said. Then she says, of course
I must do as my mother tells me, and would I
ask you to step up and see her presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were a bit too sharp with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl sniffed resentfully. &ldquo;Good riddance
if she goes,&rdquo; she called after her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs Simons knocked perfunctorily at the
dining-room door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
A young voice bade her come in. &ldquo;I
wanted to tell you that I heard from my
cousins in Italy this morning. I am going to
stay with them for a little, so I shall be leaving
you at the end of the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlady&rsquo;s cold stare was disconcerting.
There was a distinct note of disapproval in her
voice as she answered, &ldquo;I do not know much
about Italy.&rdquo; She seemed to think it not
quite a seemly subject, yet she pursued it.
&ldquo;I should have thought it was better for a
young lady without parents or friends to find
some occupation in her own country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive smiled. &ldquo;Ah, but I hate boiled
potatoes, and I think I shall love Italy and
Italian cooking. You remember the Athenians
who were always seeking some new thing?
They had a good time, Mrs Simons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you may not live to wish those
words unsaid, miss,&rdquo; the woman answered
primly. &ldquo;You have as good as sold your
birthright, as Esau did, in that speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was much nicer than Jacob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, miss, how can you! But, after all, I
suppose you are not altogether one of us since
you have foreign cousins. What&rsquo;s bred in
the bone comes out in the flesh they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite English, if that is what you
mean. My aunt married an Italian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs Simons&rsquo;s eyes had wandered from the girl&rsquo;s
face to the heavy chandelier tied up in yellow
muslin, and thence, by way of &ldquo;Bubbles,&rdquo;
framed in tarnished gilt, to the door. &ldquo;Ah,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
well, I shall take your notice,&rdquo; she said
finally.</p>

<p>She went down again into the kitchen. &ldquo;I
never know where to have her,&rdquo; she complained.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something queer and
foreign about her for all she says. What&rsquo;s
bred in the bone! I said that to her face, and
I repeat it to you, Gwendolen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs Simons might have added that adventures
are to the adventurous. Olive&rsquo;s father
was Jack Agar, of the Agars of Lyme, and he
married his cousin. If Mrs Simons had known
all that must be implied in this statement she
might have held forth at some length on the
subject of heredity, and have traced the girl&rsquo;s
dislike of boiled potatoes to her great-great-uncle&rsquo;s
friendship with Lord Byron, and her
longing for sunshine to a still more remote
ancestress, lady-in-waiting to a princess at the
court of Le Roi Soleil.</p>

<p>Adventures to the adventurous! The
Agars were always aware of the magnificent
possibilities of life and love, and inclined to
ignore the unpleasant actualities of existence
and the married state; hence some remarkable
histories, and, in the end, ruin. Olive was
the last of the old name. Jack Agar had died
at thirty, leaving his wife and child totally
unprovided for but for the little annuity that
had sufficed for dress in the far-off salad days,
and that now must be made to maintain them.
Olive was sent to a cheap boarding-school,
where she proved herself a fool at arithmetic;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
history, very good; conduct, fair; according
to her reports. She was not happy there.
She hated muddy walks and ink-stained
desks and plain dumpling, and all these things
seemed to be an essential part of life at Miss
Blake&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>She left at eighteen, and thereafter she and
her mother lived together in lodgings at
various seaside resorts within their means,
practising a strict economy, improving their
minds at the free library, doing their own dressmaking,
and keeping body and soul together
on potted meats, cocoa and patent cereals.
Mary Agar rebelled sometimes in secret,
regretting the lack of &ldquo;opportunities,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
of possible husbands. She would have been
glad to see her daughter settled. The Agars
never used commonsense in affairs of the
heart. Her own marriage had been very
foolish from a worldly point of view, and her
sister Alice had run away with her music-master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In those days girls had a governess at
home and finished with masters, and young
Signor Menotti came twice a week to our
house in Russell Square to teach Alice the
guitar and mandoline. We shared singing
and French lessons, but she had him to herself.
He was very good-looking, dark, and rather
haggard, and just shabby enough to make one
sorry for him. When Alice said she would
marry him mamma was furious, but she was just
of age, and she had a little money of her own,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
an annuity as I have, and she went her own
way. They were married at a registry office,
I think, and soon afterwards they went to his
home in Italy. Mamma never forgave, but
Alice and I used to write to each other, and
her eldest child was called after me. I don&rsquo;t
know how it turned out. She never said she
was unhappy, but she died after eight years,
leaving her three little girls to be brought up
by their father&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive knew little more than this of her aunt.
Further questioning elicited the fact that
Signor Menotti&rsquo;s name was Ernesto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girls are your cousins, Olive dear,
and you have no other relations. I should like
to see them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So should I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive knew all about the annuity, but she
had not realised until her mother died quite
suddenly, of heart failure after influenza, what
it means to have no money at all. She was
dazed with grief at first, and Mrs Simons was
as kind as could be expected and did not thrust
the weekly bill upon her on the morning after
the funeral, though it was due on that day.
But lodgers are not supposed to give much
trouble, and though death is not quite so
heinous as infectious disease or ink spilt on the
carpet it is still distinctly not a thing to be
encouraged by too great a display of sympathy,
and Olive was soon made to understand that it
behoved her to seek some means of livelihood,
some way out into the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
No proverb is too hackneyed to be comforting
at times, and the girl reminded herself
that blood is thicker than water as she looked
among her mother&rsquo;s papers for the Menotti
address. They were her cousins, birds of a
feather. She wrote them a queer, shy, charming
letter in strange Italian, laboriously learnt
out of a grammar, and then&mdash;since some days
must elapse before she could get any answer&mdash;she
conscientiously studied the advertisement
columns of the papers. She might be a nursery
governess if only she could be sure of herself
at long division, or&mdash;horrid alternative&mdash;a
useful help. Mrs Simons suggested a shop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a nice appearance, miss.
Perhaps you would do as one of the young
ladies in the drapery department, beginning
with the tapes and thread and ribbon counter,
you know, and working your way up to the
showroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Olive altogether declined to be a young
lady.</p>

<p>She waited anxiously for her cousins&rsquo; letter,
and it meant so much to her that when it came
she was half afraid to open it.</p>

<p>It was grotesquely addressed to the</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Genteel Miss Agar Olive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Marsden Street, 159,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Brighton,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Provincia di Sussex,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Inghilterra.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The post-mark was Siena. It was stamped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
on the flap, which was also decorated with a
blue bird carrying a rose in its beak, and was
rather strongly scented.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,&mdash;We were so pleased and
interested to hear from you, though we
greatly regret to have the news of our aunt&rsquo;s
death. Our father&rsquo;s sister lives with us since
we are orphans. She is a widow and has no
children of her own. If you can pay us
fifteen lire a week we shall be satisfied, and we
will try to get you pupils for English. Kindly
let us know the date and hour of your arrival.&mdash;Believe
us, yours devotedly,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Maria</span>, <span class="smcap">Gemma</span> and <span class="smcap">Carmela</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Olive read it carefully twice over, and then
sat down at the table and began to scribble
on the back of the envelope. She convinced
herself that three times fifteen was forty-five,
and that so many lire amounted to not quite
two pounds. Then there was the fare out to
be reckoned. Finally, she decided that she
would be able to get out to Italy and to live
there for three weeks before she need call
herself penniless.</p>

<p>She went to the window and stood for a
while looking out. The houses opposite and
all down the road were exactly alike, all
featureless and grey, roofed with slate, three-storied,
with basement kitchens. Nearly
every one of them had &ldquo;Apartments&rdquo; in gilt
letters on the fanlight over the front door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
It was raining. The pavements were wet and
there was mud on the roadway. The woman
who lived in the corner house was spring-cleaning.
Olive saw her helping the servant
to take down the curtains in the front room.
Dust and tea-leaves and last year&rsquo;s cobwebs.
It occurred to her that spring would bring a
recurrence of these things only if she became a
useful help, as she must if she stayed in
England and earned her living as best she could&mdash;only
these and nothing more. The idea was
horrible and she shuddered at it. &ldquo;I shall
go,&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;I shall go.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>Olive, advised by a clerk in Cook&rsquo;s office,
had taken a through ticket to Siena, third
class to Dover, first on the boat, second in
France and Italy. She got to Victoria in
good time, had her luggage labelled, secured
a corner seat, and, having twenty minutes to
spare, strolled round the bookstall, eyeing the
illustrated weeklies and the cheap reprints.
The blue and gold of a shilling edition of Keats
lay ready to her hand and she picked it up
and opened it.</p>

<p>The girl, true lover of all beauty, flushed
with pleasure at the dear, familiar word music,
the sound of Arcadian pipes heard faintly
for a moment above the harsh roar of London.
For her the dead poet&rsquo;s voice rose clearly
through the clamour of the living; it was like
the silver wailing of a violin in a blaring discord
of brass instruments.</p>

<p>She laid down the book reluctantly, and
turning, met the eager eyes of the man who
stood beside her. He had just bought an
armful of current literature, and his business
at the bookstall was evidently done, yet he
lingered for an appreciable instant. He, too,
was a lover of beauty, and in his heart he was
saying, &ldquo;Oh, English rose!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
He did not look English himself. He wore
his black hair rather longer than is usual in
this country, and there was a curiously vivid
look, a suggestion of fire about him, which is
conspicuously lacking in the average Briton,
whose ambition it is to look as cool as possible.
His face was thin and his eyes were deep set,
like those of Julius C&aelig;sar&mdash;in fact, the girl
was strongly reminded of the emperor&rsquo;s bust
in the British Museum. He looked about
thirty-five, but might have been older.</p>

<p>All this Olive saw in the brief instant during
which they stood there together and aware of
each other. When he turned away she bought
some magazines, without any great regard for
their interest or suitability, and went to take
her place in the third-class compartment she
had selected.</p>

<p>He would travel first, of course. She
watched his leisurely progress along the
platform, and noted that he was taller than
any of the other men there, and better-looking.
His thin, clean-shaven face compelled attention;
she saw some women looking at him,
and was pleased to observe that he did not
even glance at them. Then people came hurrying
up to the door of her compartment to say
good-bye to some of her fellow-travellers, and
she lost sight of him.</p>

<p>The train started and passed through the
arid wilderness of backyards that lies between
each one of the London termini and the clean
green country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Olive fluttered the pages of her magazine,
but she felt disinclined to read. She was
pretty; her brown hair framed a rose-tinted
face, her smile was charming, her blue eyes
were gay and honest and kind. Men often
looked at her, and it cannot be denied that the
swift appraisement of masculine eyes, the
momentary homage of a glance that said &ldquo;you
are fair,&rdquo; meant something to her. Such
tributes to her beauty were minor joys, to be
classed with the pleasure to be derived from
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marrons glac&eacute;s</i> or the scent of violets, but the
remembrance of them did not often make her
dream by day or bring a flush to her cheeks.</p>

<p>She roused herself presently and began to
look out of the window with the remorseful
feeling of one who has been neglecting an old
friend for an acquaintance. After all, this was
England, where she was born and where her
mother had died, and she was leaving it perhaps
for ever. She tried to fix the varying
aspects of the spring in her mind for future
reference; the tender green of the young
larches in the plantation, the pale gold of
the primroses, and the flowering gorse close
to the line, the square grey towers of the village
churches, even the cold, pinched faces of the
people waiting on the platforms of the little
stations. Italy would be otherwise, and she
might never see these familiar things again.</p>

<p>When the train rushed out on to the pier
at Dover she dared not look back at the white
cliffs, but kept her eyes resolutely seaward.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
The wind was high, and she heard that the
crossing would be rough. C&aelig;sar was close
behind her, and she caught a glimpse of him
going aft as she made her way to the ladies&rsquo;
cabin.</p>

<p>She lay down on one of the red velvet
divans in the stuffy saloon, and closed her
eyes as she had been advised to do, and in ten
minutes her misery was complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are going to be ill nothing will stop
you,&rdquo; observed the sympathetic stewardess.
&ldquo;It is like Monte Carlo. Most people have a
system, and sometimes they win, but they are
bound to lose in the end. Champagne, munching
biscuits, patent medicines, lying down as
you are now. It is all vanity and vexation of
spirit, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive joined feebly in her laugh. &ldquo;I feel
better now. Are we nearly there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just coming into harbour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Olive crawled up on deck her one idea,
after her luggage, was to avoid anyone who
had seemed to admire her. She could not
bear that the man should see her green face,
and she was grateful to him for keeping his
distance in the crush to get off the boat, and
for disappearing altogether in the station. A
porter in a blue linen blouse piloted her to the
waiting train, and she climbed into the compartment
labelled &ldquo;Turin,&rdquo; and settled herself
in a window seat.</p>

<p>The country between Calais and Paris can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
only be described as flat, stale and unprofitable
by a beauty lover panting for the light and
glow and colour of the South, and Olive soon
got a book out of her bag and began to read.
Her only fellow-passenger, a middle-aged
English lady with an indefinite face, spoke
to her presently. &ldquo;You are reading a French
novel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is in Italian. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Citt&agrave; Morta</i>, by
Gabriele D&rsquo;Annunzio. I want to rub up my
few words of the language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he not a very terrible writer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive was so tired of the disapproving note.
&ldquo;He writes very well, and his descriptions are
gorgeous. Of course he is horrid sometimes,
but one can skip those parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive smiled. &ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; she said
frankly, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t enjoy them. They
make me tired of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not that rather a pity?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; but you have to sift dirt to find
diamonds, don&rsquo;t you? And this man says
things that are worth tiaras sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely there must be Italian authors who
write books suitable for young people in a
pretty style?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty style? No doubt. But I don&rsquo;t
read them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older woman sighed, and then smiled
quite pleasantly. &ldquo;I suppose you are clever.
One of my nieces is, and they find her rather a
handful. Will you try one of my sandwiches?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Olive produced her biscuits and bananas,
and they munched together in amity. After
all, an aunt might be worse than stupid, and
this one was quite good-natured, and so kind
that her taste in literature might be excused.
There were affectionate farewells at the Paris
station, where she got out with all her accumulation
of bags and bundles.</p>

<p>The train rushed on through the woods
of Fontainebleau and across wide plains intersected
by poplar-fringed canals. As the
evening mists rose lights began to twinkle in
cottage windows, and in the villages the church
bells were ringing the prayer to the Virgin.
Olive had laid aside her book some time since,
and now, wearying of the grey twilit world,
she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Jean Avenel, too, had watched the waning
of the day from his place in a smoking first for
a while, before he got up and began to prowl
restlessly about the corridors. &ldquo;She will be
so tired if she does not eat,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;They ought not to let a child like that travel
alone. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; He walked down the
corridor again, but this time he looked into
each compartment. He saw three Englishmen
and an American playing whist, Germans
eating, and French people sleeping, and at last
he came upon his rose. A small man, mean-featured
and scrubby-haired, was seated
opposite to her, and his shining eyes were fixed
upon her face. She had taken off her hat and
was holding it on her lap, and Jean saw that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
she was clutching at it nervously, and that she
was pale. He understood that it was probably
her first experience of the Italian stare, deliberate,
merciless, and indefinitely prolonged.
She flushed as he came forward, and her eyes
were eloquent as they met his. He sat down
beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please forgive me,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;but
I can see this man is annoying you. Shall I
glare him out of the place? I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please do,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He has
frightened me so. He was talking before you
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The culprit already looked disconcerted and
rather foolish, and now, as Jean leant forward
and seemed about to speak to him, he began
to be frightened. He fidgeted, thrusting his
hands in his pockets, looking out of the
window, humming a tune. His ears grew red.
He tried to meet the other man&rsquo;s level gaze
and failed. He got up rather hurriedly. The
brown eyes watched him slinking out before
they allowed themselves a second sight of the
rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; said Olive. &ldquo;I
feel as if you had killed a spider for me, or
an earwig. He was more like an earwig.
He must have come in here while I was
asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A deported waiter going back to his native
Naples, I imagine,&rdquo; Jean said. &ldquo;They ought
not to have let you travel alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled. &ldquo;I am a law unto myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
&ldquo;That is a pity. Will you think me very
impertinent if I confess that I have been
watching over you&mdash;at a respectful distance&mdash;ever
since we left Victoria? I do not approve
of children wandering&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tilted her pretty chin at him. &ldquo;Children!
So you have made yourself into a sort of
G.F.S. for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;we have
a mutual friend.&rdquo; He drew a blue and gold
volume from an inner pocket.</p>

<p>Olive flushed scarlet, but she only said,
&ldquo;Oh, Keats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at his hands as they turned the
pages; they were clever and kind, she thought,
and she wondered if he was an artist or a
doctor. Those fingers might set a butterfly&rsquo;s
wing, and yet they seemed very strong. She
did not know she had sighed until he said,
&ldquo;Am I boring you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she answered eagerly. &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t go yet unless you want to. But tell me
why you bought that book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could have seen yourself as I saw
you, you would understand,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I once saw a woman on my brother&rsquo;s estate
pick up a piece of gold on the road. She had
never had so much money without earning
it in her life before, I suppose. At any rate
she kissed it, and her face was radiant. She
was old and ugly and worn by her long days of
toil in the fields, and you&mdash;&nbsp;Well, in spite of
the differences you reminded me of her, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
am curious to know which poem of Keats
brought that swift, rapt light of joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was &lsquo;White hawthorn and the pastoral
eglantine&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean found the place and marked the
passage before returning the book to his pocket.
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will come with me and
have some dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>Many women are shepherded through all life&rsquo;s
journeyings by their men&mdash;fathers, brothers,
husbands&mdash;who look out their trains for them,
put them in the care of guards, and shield
them from all contact with sulky porters and
extortionate cabmen. Olive, who had always
to take her own ticket and fight her own and
her mother&rsquo;s battles, now tasted the joys of
irresponsibility with Avenel. He compounded
with Customs officials, who bowed
low before him, he took part in the midnight
scramble for pillows at Modane, emerging
from the crowd in triumph with no less
than three of the coveted aids to repose under
his arm, and he saw Olive comfortably settled
in another compartment with two motherly
German women, and there left her.</p>

<p>At Turin he secured places in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">diretto</i>
to Florence, and sent his man to the buffet for
coffee and rolls, and the two broke their fast
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Italy and the joy of life,&rdquo; Olive said
lightly, as she lifted her cup, and he looked at
her with melancholy brown eyes that yet held
the ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The passing hour,&rdquo; he answered; adding
prosaically, &ldquo;This is good coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Referring to the grey silvery trees whose
name she bore he assured her that he did not
think she resembled them. &ldquo;They are old and
you seem eternally young. You should have
been called Primavera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;Ah, if you had been my
godfather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not have cared to have held you in
my arms when you were a bald-headed baby,&rdquo;
he answered with perfect gravity.</p>

<p>Apparently he always said what he thought,
but his frankness was disconcerting, and Olive
changed the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Siena beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a gem of the Renaissance, and you
will love it as I do, I know, but I wish you
could have seen Florence first. My brother
has a villa at Settignano and I am going there
now. The fruit trees in the orchard will be all
white with blossom. You remember Romeo&rsquo;s
April oath: &lsquo;By yonder moon that tips with
silver all these fruit-tree tops&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They lunched in the station restaurant at
Genoa, and there he bought the girl a basket
of fruit. &ldquo;A poor substitute for the tea you
will be wanting presently,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;You have no tea-basket with you? You will
want one if you are going to live with Italians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I send you one?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
&ldquo;Do let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive flushed with pleasure. No one had
been so kind to her since her mother died.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Evidently he liked her&mdash;oh! he liked her very
much. She suddenly realised how much she
would miss him when they parted at Florence
and she had to go on alone. It had been so
good to be with someone stronger than herself
who would take care of her. He had seemed
happy too, and she thought he looked younger
now than he did when she first saw him standing
by the bookstall at Victoria station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very good of you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
should like it. Thank you. I&mdash;I shall be
sorry to say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He met her wistful eyes gravely. &ldquo;I
should like you to know that I shall never
forget this day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall never
cease to be grateful to you for being so&mdash;for
being what you are. My wife is different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t live with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a card from his case presently and
scribbled an address on it. &ldquo;I dare not hope
that I shall ever hear from you again, but that
is my name, and letters will always be forwarded
to me from my brother&rsquo;s place. If
ever I could do anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She faltered some word of thanks in an uncertain
voice. She felt as if something had
come upon her for which she was unprepared,
some shadow of the world&rsquo;s pain, some flame
of its fires that flickered at her heart for a
moment and was gone. She was suddenly
afraid, not of the brown eyes that were fixed
so hungrily upon her face, but of herself. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
could hear the beating of her own heart. The
pity of it&mdash;the pity of it! He was so nice.
Why could not they be friends&mdash;</p>

<p>The night had fallen long since and they
were nearing Florence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to change at Empoli,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I will send my man on as far as that
to look after you. Will you let me kiss you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came over and sat on the seat by her
side. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo;
he said gently, and then, seeing her pale, he
drew back. &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. It would not be
fair. Oh, I beg your pardon! It will be
enough for me to remember how good you
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train passed into the lighted station,
and he stood up and took his hat and coat
from the rack before he turned to her once
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Has anyone seen our cousin?&rdquo; asked Gemma
as she helped herself to <i>spaghetti</i>.</p>

<p>Her aunt shrugged her fat shoulders. &ldquo;No!
The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">donna di servizio</i> is mistress here, and she
has ordained that the cousin shall not be disturbed.
She has even locked the door, and
she carries the key in her pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; old Carolina said placidly.
She was accustomed to join in the conversation
at table when she chose, and Italian
servants are allowed great freedom of speech.
&ldquo;You were all in your beds when Giovanni
Scampo drove her here in his cab this morning
or you would have seen her then. The poor
child is half dead with fatigue. Let her sleep,
I say. There are veal cutlets to come,
Signorina Maria; will you have more <i>spaghetti</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman shook her head. &ldquo;You
eat too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Menotti lived in a small stuffy flat on
the third floor of 25, Piazza Tolomei. It had
the one advantage of being central, but was
otherwise extremely inconvenient. The
kitchen was hot and airless, and the servant
had to sleep in a dark cupboard adjoining, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
an atmosphere compounded of the scent of
cheese, black beetles and old boots. There
were four bedrooms besides, all opening on to
the dining-room; and a tiny drawing-room,
seldom used and never dusted, was filled to
overflowing with gilt furniture and decorative
fantasies in wool work.</p>

<p>The Menotti did not entertain. They met
their friends at church, or at the theatre, or in
the Lizza gardens, where they walked every
evening in the summer. No man had ever seen
them other than well dressed, but in the house
they wore loose white cotton jackets and old
skirts. They were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en d&eacute;shabill&eacute;</i> now, though
their heads were elaborately dressed and their
faces powdered, and Maria&rsquo;s waist was considerably
larger than it appeared to be when she
was socially &ldquo;visible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must breathe sometimes,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The three girls were inclined to stoutness,
but Gemma drank vinegar and ate sparingly,
and so had succeeded in keeping herself slim
hitherto, though she was only three years
younger than Maria, who was twenty-nine
and looked forty.</p>

<p>Carmela was podgy, but she might lace or
not just as she pleased. No one would look
at her in any case since her kind, good-humoured,
silly face was marked with smallpox.</p>

<p>Gemma was the pride of her aunt and the
hope of the family. The girls were poor, and
it is hard for such to find husbands, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had recently become engaged to a young
lawyer from Lucca, who had been staying with
friends in Siena when he saw and fell in love
with the girl whom the students at the University
named the &ldquo;Odalisque.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hers was the strange, boding loveliness of a
pale orchid. She had no colour, but her
curved lips were faintly pink, as were the
palms of her soft, idle hands. &ldquo;I shall be
glad when she is married,&rdquo; her aunt said
often. &ldquo;It is very well for Maria or Carmela
to go through the streets alone, but Gemma
is otherwise, and I cannot be always running
after her. Then her temper ... <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio mio!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is the vinegar,&rdquo; suggested
Carolina rather spitefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. She wants a husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the dinner was over Signora Carosi
went to her room to lie down, and her two
elder nieces followed her example, but Carmela
passed into the kitchen with Carolina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will let me see the cousin,&rdquo; she said,
wheedling. &ldquo;Gemma thinks she will be ugly,
with great teeth and a red face like the
Englishwomen in the Asino, but I do not
believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the signorina is hoping for a miracle of
plainness she will be unpleasantly surprised,&rdquo;
said the old woman, and her shrivelled face was
as mischievous as a monkey&rsquo;s as she drew the
key of Olive&rsquo;s room from her pocket. &ldquo;I am
going to take her some soup now, and you shall
come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
It is quite impossible to be retiring, or even
modest, in the mid-Victorian sense, in flats.
A bedroom cannot remain an inviolate sanctuary
when it affords the only means of access
to the bathroom or is a short cut to the
kitchen. Olive had had some experience of
suburban flats during holidays spent with
school friends, and had suffered the familiarity
that breeds weariness in such close quarters.
As she woke now she was unpleasantly aware
of strangers in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a lover or a nurse may look at
a woman while she sleeps without offence,&rdquo;
she said drowsily. &ldquo;It is an unpardonable
liberty in all other classes of the population.
Are you swains, or sisters of mercy?&rdquo;
She opened her eyes and met Carmela&rsquo;s puzzled
stare with laughter. &ldquo;I was saying that when
one is ill or in love one can endure many
things,&rdquo; she explained in halting Italian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Carmela said uncomprehendingly,
&ldquo;I am never ill, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grazia a Dio</i>, but when Maria
has an indigestion she is cross, and when
Gemma is in love her temper is dreadful.
Perhaps, being a foreigner, you are different.
Are you tired?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, rather, but go on talking to
me. I am not sleepy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carmela, nothing loth, drew a chair to the
bedside. &ldquo;You need not get up yet,&rdquo; she
said comfortably. &ldquo;We always lie down
after dinner until five, and later we go for a
walk. You will see the Via Cavour full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
people in the evening, officers and students,
and mothers with daughters to be married,
all walking up and down and looking at each
other. Orazio Lucis first saw Gemma like
that, and he followed us home, and then found
out who we were and asked questions about us.
Every day we saw him in the Piazza, smoking
cigarettes, and waiting for us to go out that he
might follow us, and Gemma would give him
one look, and then cast down her eyes ...
so!&rdquo; Carmela caricatured her sister&rsquo;s
affectation of unconsciousness very successfully,
and looked to Olive and Carolina for
applause.</p>

<p>The servant grinned appreciation. &ldquo;Yes,
the signorina is very <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">civetta</i>. I, also, have
seen her simpering when the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">avvocato</i> has been
here, but she soon gets tired of him, and then
her face is as God made it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive dressed herself leisurely when they
had left her, and unpacked her clothes and her
little store of books. Her cousins, coming to
fetch her soon after six o&rsquo;clock, found her
ready to go out, but so absorbed in a guide-book
of Siena that she did not hear Maria&rsquo;s
knock at the door.</p>

<p>She had resolved that she would apply art
and arch&aelig;ology as plasters to the wound life
had given her already. She would stay her
heart&rsquo;s hunger with moods and tenses, but
not of the verb &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">amare</i>.&rdquo; Learning and
teaching, she might make her mind lord of her
emotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
She came forward rather shyly to meet her
cousins. The three together were somewhat
overpowering, flounced and frilled alike, and
highly scented. Maria and Carmela fat,
pleasant and profuse; Gemma silent, with
dark resentful eyes and scornful lips that never
smiled at other women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will show me the best things?&rdquo;
Olive said eagerly when they had all kissed
her. &ldquo;I want to see the Duomo first, and
then the Palazzo Vecchio&mdash;but that is only open
in the mornings, is it? And this is the Piazza
Tolomei, so the house where Pia lived must be
quite near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemma stared, but made no attempt to
answer, and Maria looked confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you will find us all very stupid,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cara</i>,&rdquo; said Carmela, apologetically. &ldquo;We
only go to the Duomo to pray, and as to
museums and picture-galleries&mdash;&nbsp;And perhaps
I had better tell you now, at once,
that we do not want to learn English. We
have got you several lessons through friends,
but Maria and Carmela say they will not
fatigue themselves over a foreign language,
and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; began Olive, &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemma interrupted her. &ldquo;A thousand
thanks,&rdquo; she said rudely. &ldquo;We are not
school children; we read about Pia dei Tolomei
years ago at the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scuola Normale</i>, but we do
not consider her an amusing subject of conversation
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
The rose in Olive&rsquo;s cheeks deepened. &ldquo;I
shall soon learn to know your likes and dislikes,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and to understand your
manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; answered Gemma as she left
the room. Maria hurried after her, but the
younger sister caught at Olive&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not listen to Gemma. Come,
we will walk together. Let her go on; she
cannot forgive your nose for being straight.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>


<p>A large parcel addressed to Miss Agar was
brought to the house a few weeks later. Olive
was out giving a lesson when it came, and
Gemma turned it over, examining the post-mark
and the writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I open it and see what is inside?
She would never know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carmela was horrified. &ldquo;How can you
think of such a thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, it is sealed,&rdquo; added Maria.</p>

<p>These two liked their cousin well enough,
and when they wished to tease the Odalisque
they called her &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carina</i>&rdquo; and praised her
fresh prettiness. It was always so easy to
make Gemma angry, and lately she had been
more capricious and difficult than ever. Her
sisters were continually trying to excuse
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is so nervous,&rdquo; Maria said loyally,
but her paraphrase availed nothing. Olive
understood her cousin and disliked her extremely,
though she accorded her a reluctant
admiration.</p>

<p>She came in now with her books&mdash;an English
grammar and a volume of translations&mdash;under
her arm, and seeing that Gemma was watching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
her, she took her parcel with a carefully expressionless
phrase of thanks to Carmela,
who was anxious to cut the string, and carried
it into her room unopened. It was the tea-basket
Jean Avenel had promised her. She
read the enclosed note, however, before she
looked at it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I am going to America and then to Russia.
Do not quite forget me. If ever you need
anything write to my brother, Hilaire Avenel,
Villa Fiorelli, Settignano, near Florence, and
he will serve you for my sake as he would for
your own if he knew you. I think I have
played better since I have known you, my
rose. One must suffer much before one can
express the divine sorrow of Chopin. I said
I would not write, but some promises are made
to be broken. Can you forgive me?</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jean Avenel.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>America and Russia ... the divine sorrow
of Chopin ... I have played better.... He
was a pianist then, and surely a great one.
Olive remembered the slender brown hands
that had seemed to her so supple and so
strong. But the name of Avenel was strange
to her, and she was sure she had never
seen it on posters, or in the papers and
magazines that chronicle the doings of musical
celebrities.</p>

<p>She took the tea-things out of the basket
one by one and looked at them with pleasure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The sugar box and the caddy and the spoon
were all of silver, and engraved with her initials,
and the cup and saucer were painted with
garlands of pale roses.</p>

<p>Tears filled her eyes as she sat down at the
little table in the window and began to write.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;You have sent me a tea equipage fit for
an empress! It is perfect, and I do not know
how to thank you. Yes. I forgive you for
writing. Have I really helped you to play?
I am so glad. You say Chopin, so I suppose
it is the piano? I must tell you that I remember
all the stories you told me of Siena,
and they add to the interest of my days. I
give English lessons, and am making enough
money to keep myself, but in the intervals of
grammar and &lsquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">I Promessi Sposi</i>&rsquo; (no less than
three of my pupils are translating that interminable
romance into so-called English) I
study the architecture of the early Renaissance
in the old narrow streets, and gaze upon
Byzantine Madonnas in the churches. The
Duomo is an archangel&rsquo;s dream, and I like to
go there with my cousins and steep my soul
in its beauty while they say their prayers and
fan themselves. One of them is pretty and
she hates me; the other two are stout and kind
and empty-headed, and their aunt is nothing&mdash;a
large, heavy nothing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Olive laid down her pen. &ldquo;What will he
think if I write him eight pages? That I want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to begin a correspondence? I do, but he must
not know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tore her letter up into small pieces
and wrote two lines on a sheet of note-paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for your kind
present and for what you say. Of course I
forgive you ... and I shall not forget.&mdash;Yours
sincerely,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Olive Agar</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>She went to the window and threw the torn
scraps of the first letter out into the street,
and then she sat down again and began to cry;
not for long. Women who know how precious
youth is understand that tears are an expensive
luxury, and they are sparing of
them accordingly. They suffer more in the
stern repression of their emotions than do
those who yield easily to grief, but they keep
their eyelashes and their complexions.</p>

<p>Olive bathed her eyes presently and smoked
a cigarette to calm her nerves. She was
going out that evening to dine with her
favourite pupil and his mother, and she knew
they would be distressed if she looked ill or
sad.</p>

<p>Aurelia de Sanctis had had troubles enough
of her own. She had married a patriot, a man
with a beautiful eager face and a body spent
with disease, and a fever that never left him
since the days when he lurked in the marshes
of the Maremma, crouched in a tangle of wet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
reeds and rushes, and watching for the flash
of steel in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Austrian bayonets ... he raved of them in
his dreams, and called upon the names of
comrades who had rotted in prisons or died
in exile. His young wife nursed him devotedly
until he died, leaving her a widow at
twenty-seven. She had a small pension from
the Government, and she worked at dressmaking
to eke it out.</p>

<p>Her only child had grown up to be a hopeless
invalid. He could not go to school, so he lay
all day on the sofa by the window in the tiny
sitting-room and helped his mother with her
sewing. His poor little bony hands were very
quick and dexterous.</p>

<p>In the evenings he read everything he could
get hold of, books and newspapers. The professors
from the University, who came to see
him and were kind to him for his father&rsquo;s sake,
told each other that he was a genius and that
his soul was eating up his frail body. They
wondered, pitifully, what poor Signora Aurelia
would do when&mdash;</p>

<p>The mother was hopeful, however. &ldquo;He
takes such an interest in everything that I
think he must have a strong vitality though
he seems delicate,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He had expressed a wish to learn English,
and when Signora Aurelia first heard of Olive
she wrote asking her to come and see her. The
De Sancti lived a little way outside the Porta
Romana, on the edge of the hill and outside the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
town, and Maria advised her cousin not to go
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so far out on a hot dusty road, and
you will grow as thin and dry as an old hen&rsquo;s
drumstick if you walk so much. And I know
the signora is poor and will not be able to pay
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive went, nevertheless. Signora Aurelia
herself opened the door to her and showed
evident pleasure at seeing her. The poor
woman had been beautiful, and now that she
was worn by time and sorrow she still looked
like a goddess, exiled to earth, and altogether
shabby&mdash;a deity in reduced circumstances&mdash;but
none the less divinely fair and kind. Her
great love for her child had so moulded her
that she seemed the very incarnation of
motherhood. So might Ceres have appeared
as she wandered forlornly in search of her lost
Persephone, gentle, weary, her fineness a little
blunted by her woes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the English signorina? Come
in! My son will be so pleased,&rdquo; she said as
she led the girl into the room where Astorre
was working at embroidery.</p>

<p>Olive saw a boy of seventeen sewing as he
lay on the sofa. There were some books on
the floor within his reach, and a glass of
lemonade was set upon the window-sill, but he
seemed quite absorbed in making fine stitches.
He looked up, however, as they came in and
smiled at his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nearly finished,&rdquo; he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
&ldquo;Presently I shall read the sonnet, &lsquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pace non
trovo, e non ho da far guerra</i>,&rsquo; to refresh
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the signorina who teaches English,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nino mio</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face lit up at once and he held out
his hand. &ldquo;I have already studied the
grammar, but the pronunciation ... ah!
that will be hard to learn. Will you help me,
signorina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed I will. We will read and talk
together, and soon you will speak English
better than I can Italian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke and smiled her heart ached to
see the hollowness of his cheeks and the lines
of pain about his young mouth. She guessed
that his poor body was all twisted and deformed
under the rug that covered it. Signora
Aurelia took her out on to their little terrace
garden before she left. Twenty miles and
more of fair Tuscan earth lay at their feet,
grey olive groves and green vineyards, and the
hills beyond all shimmering in the first heat of
spring. Olive exclaimed at the beauty of the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. On summer evenings Astorre can
lie here and watch what he calls the pageant
of the skies. The poor child is so fond of
colour. I know you will be very patient with
him, signorina. He is so clever, but some
days he is in pain, and then he gets tired and
so cannot learn so well. You have kindly
promised to come twice a week, but I must tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
you that I am not rich&mdash;&rdquo; She looked at Olive
wistfully.</p>

<p>The girl dared not offer to teach Astorre for
nothing. &ldquo;I can see your son will be a very
good pupil,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;Would one
lire the lesson suit you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; the signora said with evident
relief. &ldquo;But are you sure that is enough?
You must not sacrifice yourself, my dear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a pleasure to come,&rdquo; Olive said
very sincerely.</p>

<p>The acquaintance soon ripened into a
triangular friendship. The signora grew to
love the girl because she amused Astorre and
was never obviously sorry for him, or too
gentle with him, as were some of the well-meaning
people who came to see the boy.
&ldquo;An overflow of pity is like grease exuding,&rdquo;
he said once. &ldquo;I hate it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was very old for his years. He had read
everything apparently, and he discussed
problems of life and death with the air of a
man of forty. He had no illusions about
himself. &ldquo;I shall die,&rdquo; he said once to Olive
when his mother was not in the room. &ldquo;My
father gave me a spirit that burns like Greek
fire and a body like&mdash;like a spent shell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The easy, desultory lessons were often prolonged,
and then the girl stayed to dinner and
played dominoes afterwards with him or with
his mother until ten o&rsquo;clock, when old Carolina
came to fetch her home. The withered little
serving-woman was voluble, and always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
cheerfully ready to lighten the way with
descriptions of the last moments of her
children. She had had thirteen, and two were
still surviving. &ldquo;One grows accustomed,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">signorina mia</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>


<p>&ldquo;You have been crying,&rdquo; Astorre said abruptly.</p>

<p>Olive leant against the balustrade of the
little terrace. She was watching the fireflies
that sparkled in the dusk of the vineyards
in the valley below. A breeze had risen
from the sea at sunset, and it stirred the leaves
of the climbing roses and brought a faint
sound of convent bells far away. Some stars
shone in the clear pale sky.</p>

<p>Dinner had been cleared away, and Signora
Aurelia had gone in to finish a white dress she
was making for a bride. Olive had offered to
help her. &ldquo;I would rather you amused yourself
with Astorre. I can see you are tired,&rdquo;
she had answered as she left them together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been crying,&rdquo; the boy repeated
insistently.</p>

<p>She smiled at him then. &ldquo;May I not shed
tears if I choose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must know why,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a castle in Spain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her searchingly. &ldquo;And a
castellan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I want a man, and I cannot have
him. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ecco!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not expect him to take her seriously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
but he was often perversely inclined. &ldquo;Of
course,&rdquo; he said in a matter-of-fact tone,
&ldquo;all women want a man or men. Do you
think I have been lying here all these years
without finding that out? That need is the
mainspring of life, the key to heaven, and the
root of all evil. If&mdash;if I were different someone
would want me&mdash;&rdquo; His voice broke.</p>

<p>Olive looked away from him. &ldquo;How still
the night is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The nightingales
are singing in the woods below, Astorre. Do
you hear them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not deaf,&rdquo; he answered in a muffled
voice, &ldquo;I hear them. Will you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Watching her closely he saw that she shrank
from him. &ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; he said
gruffly. &ldquo;I am not going to be a fool. No
man on earth is worth your tears. That is
all I wanted to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, child, you are young for all your
wisdom. I was not sorry for him but for
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liar!&rdquo; he cried petulantly, and then
caught at her hand. &ldquo;Forgive me! Come
now and read me a sonnet of your Keats and
then translate it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obediently she stooped to pick up the book.
The flame of the little lamp on the table at his
side burned steadily.</p>

<p>He lay with closed eyes and lips that moved,
repeating the words after her. &ldquo;It is very
good to listen to your voice while you are
here with me alone under the stars,&rdquo; he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
presently. &ldquo;Tell me, does this man love
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he love you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he did, but perhaps he has forgotten
me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; the boy said deliberately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot come again if you talk like this,
Astorre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never say it again,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;but I want you to remember that it is so,
because it may comfort you. Such words
never come amiss to women. They feed on
the hunger of our hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is true
that I like you to be fond of me, and I love
you. In the best way, Astorre&mdash;oh, do believe
that it is the best way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your soul, I suppose? Do you
think I am an angel because I am a cripple?&rdquo;
he asked bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little girl,&rdquo; he said more gently, &ldquo;I
have hurt you instead of comforting you, as I
meant to do. But how can I give what is not
mine? How can I cry &lsquo;Peace,&rsquo; when there
is no peace? You will suffer still when I am
at rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s mother put down her work
presently and came out to them, and the three
sat silently watching the moon rise beyond the
hills. It was as though a veil had been withdrawn
to show the glimmer of distant streams,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the white walls of peasant dwellings set among
their vines, the belfry tower of an old Carthusian
monastery belted in by tall dark
cypresses, and the twisted shadows thrown by
the gnarled trunks and outstanding roots of
the olive trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All blue and silver,&rdquo; cried the girl after a
while. &ldquo;Thank God for Italy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has cost her children dear,&rdquo; the elder
woman answered, sighing. &ldquo;Beyond that
rampart of hills lies the Maremma, and
swamps, marshes, forests are to be drained
now, they say, and made profitable. You will
see some peasants from over there in our
streets at the time of the Palio. Poor souls!
They are so lean and haggard and yellow that
their bones seem to be piercing through their
discoloured skins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Palio! I think Signor Lucis is
coming to Siena to see it,&rdquo; Olive said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the man your cousin Gemma is to
marry?&rdquo; the dressmaker asked curiously.
&ldquo;I had heard that she was engaged, but one
hears so many things. Do you like her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very much, but really I see very little
of her. I am out all day teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door-bell clanged as the girl rose to go.
&ldquo;That is Carolina come for her stray sheep,&rdquo;
she said, smiling. &ldquo;They will not believe that
I can come home by myself at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are quite right. If your aunt&rsquo;s
servant did not come for you I should take
you back to the Piazza Tolomei myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
&ldquo;You forget that I am English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive never attempted to explain her code;
she stated her nationality and went on her
way. Her first pupils had all been young girls,
but as it became known that she was really
English her circle widened. The prior of a
Dominican convent near San Giorgio, and two
privates from a regiment of Lancers stationed
in the Fortezza, came to her to be taught, and
some of Astorre&rsquo;s friends, students at the
University, were very anxious for lessons, and
as the Menotti refused to have them in their
house Olive had to hire a room to receive
them.</p>

<p>The aunt disapproved. &ldquo;It is not right,&rdquo;
she said, and when Olive assured her that she
could not afford to lose good pupils she shook
her large head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will go your own way, I suppose, but
do not bring your men here. I cannot have
soldiers scratching up the carpet with their
spurs, or monks dropping snuff on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive&rsquo;s days were filled, and she, having no
time for the self-tormentings of idle women,
was content to be not quite unhappy. She
needed love and could not rest without it, and
she was at least partially satisfied. Astorre
and his mother adored her, thought her perfect,
held her dear. All her pupils seemed to like
her, and some of the students brought her
little gifts of flowers, and packets of chocolate
and almond-rock that Maria ate for her. The
prior gave her a plaster statuette of St
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Catherine. &ldquo;She was clever, and so are you,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carmela, I am not really <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">antipatica</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What foolishness! No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does Gemma hate me then? No one
else does, or if they do they hide it, but she
looks daggers at me always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carmela had been invited to tea in her
cousin&rsquo;s bedroom. The water did not boil
yet, but her mouth was already full of cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened the other night when
Gemma let you in?&rdquo; she mumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she say anything to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I am not blind or deaf. You have
not spoken to each other since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive lifted the kettle off the spirit lamp.
&ldquo;You like it weak, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and three lumps of sugar. Tell me
what happened, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cara</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as I came up the stairs that night I
noticed a strong scent of tobacco&mdash;good
tobacco. Sienese boys smoke cheap cigarettes,
and the older men get black Tuscan
cigars, but this was different. It reminded me
of&mdash;&nbsp;Oh, well, never mind. When I came
to the first landing I felt sure there was someone
standing close against the wall waiting
for me to go by, and yet when I spoke no one
answered. You know how dark it is on the
stairs at night. I could not see anything, but
I listened, and, Carmela, a watch was ticking
quite near me, by my ear. I could not move
for a moment, and then I heard Carolina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
calling&mdash;she was with me, you know, but she
had gone up first&mdash;and I got up somehow.
Gemma let us in. She said she had been
asleep, and I noticed that her hair was all
loose and tumbled. I told her I fancied there
was someone lurking on the stairs, and she
said it must have been the cat, but I knew from
the way she said it that she was angry. She
lit her candle and marched off into her own
room without saying good-night, and I was
sorry because I have always wanted to be
friends with her. I thought I would try to say
something about it, so I went to her door and
knocked. She opened it directly. &lsquo;Go away,
spy,&rsquo; she said very distinctly, and then I grew
angry too. I laughed. &lsquo;So there was a man
on the stairs,&rsquo; I said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carmela stirred her tea thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How nice these spoons
are. I wish you would tell me who gave
them to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She helped herself to another cake. &ldquo;Gemma
is difficult, and we shall all be glad
when September comes and she is safely
married. She is lazy. You have seen us of
a morning, cutting out, basting, stitching at
her wedding clothes, while she sits with her
hands folded. Are you coming out with us
this evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Menotti strolled down to the Lizza
nearly every day after the <i>siesta</i>, and Carmela
often persuaded her cousin to accompany
them. The gardens were set on an outlying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
spur of the hill on which the wolf&rsquo;s foster son,
Remus, built the city that was to be fairer
than Rome. The winter winds, coming
swiftly from the sea, whipped the laurels into
strange shapes, shook the brown seed pods
from the bare boughs of the acacias, and froze
the water that dripped from the Medicean
balls on the old wall of the Fortezza. Even
in summer a little breeze would spring up
towards sunset, and the leaves that had
hung heavy and flaccid on the trees in the
blazing heat of noon would be stirred by it to
some semblance of life, while the shadows
lengthened, and the incessant maddening
scream of the locusts died down into silence.
The gardens were a favourite resort. As the
church bells rang the Ave Maria the people
came to them by Camollia and San Domenico,
to see each other and to talk over the news of
the day.</p>

<p>Smart be-ribboned nurses carrying babies
on white silk cushions tied with pink or blue
rosettes, young married women with their
children, stout mothers chaperoning the
elaborate vivacity of their daughters, occupied
seats near the bandstand, or lingered about
the paths as they chattered and fanned themselves
incessantly to the strains of the Intermezzo
from <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cavalleria Rusticana</i> or some
march of Verdi&rsquo;s. A great gulf was fixed
between the sexes on these occasions. The
young men congregated about the base of
Garibaldi&rsquo;s statue; more or less gilded youths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
devoted to &ldquo;le Sport,&rdquo; wearing black woollen
jerseys and perforated cycling shoes, while
lady-killers braved strangulation in four-inch
collars. There were soldiers too, cavalry
lieutenants, slender, erect, and very conscious
of their charms, and dark-faced priests, who
listened to the music carefully with their eyes
fixed on the ground, as being in the crowd but
not of it. Olive watched them all with
mingled amusement and impatience. If only
the boys would talk to their friends&rsquo; sisters
instead of eyeing them furtively from afar;
if only the girls would refrain from useless
needlework and empty laughter. They
talked incessantly and called every mortal&mdash;and
immortal&mdash;thing <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carina</i>. Queen Margherita
was <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carina</i>, and so was the new cross-stitch,
and so was this blue-eyed Olive. Yes,
they admitted her alien charm. She was
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">strana</i>, too, but they did not use that word
when she was there or she would have rejoiced
over such an enlargement of their
vocabulary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are amiable,&rdquo; she told Astorre,
&ldquo;but we have not one idea in common.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can one woman ever praise
another without that &lsquo;but&rsquo;? Do you think
them pretty?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but one does not notice them when
Gemma is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the pale one, isn&rsquo;t it? I have
heard of her from the students, and also from
the professors of the University. One of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
friends raves about her Greek profile and her
straight black brows. He calls her his silent
Sappho, but I fancy Odalisque is a better
name for her. There is no brain or heart, is
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered uncertainly.
&ldquo;She seldom speaks to anyone, never to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is jealous of you probably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heats of July tried the boy. He was
not so well as he had been in the spring, and
lately he had not been able to help his mother
with her needlework. The hours of enforced
idleness seemed very long, and he watched for
Olive&rsquo;s coming with pathetic eagerness. She
never failed to appear on Tuesdays and Saturdays,
though the lessons had been given up
since his head ached when he tried to learn.
Signora Aurelia met her always at the door
with protestations of gratitude. &ldquo;You amuse
him and make him laugh, my dear, because
you are so fresh, and you do not mind what
you say. It is good of you to come so far in
the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s heart ached to see the haggard
young face so white against the dark velvet of
the piled-up cushions. The deep grey eyes
lit up with pleasure at the sight of her, but she
found it hard to meet their yearning with a
smile.</p>

<p>Sometimes she found old men sitting with
him, grave and potent signiors, professors from
the University, who, on being introduced,
beamed paternally and asked her questions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
about Oxford and Cambridge. There were
bashful youths too, who blushed when she
entered and rose hurriedly with muttered
excuses. If they could be induced to stay,
Olive, seeing that it pleased Astorre to see
them shuffling their feet and writhing on their
chairs in an agony of embarrassment before
her, did her best to make them uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friends are all so timid,&rdquo; she said.
He looked at her with a kind of triumph, a
pride of possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do not understand you as I do.
Fausto admires you, but you frighten him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he Gemma&rsquo;s adorer?&rdquo; she asked with
a careful display of indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is always <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">amoroso</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Does he smoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; she said. She did not
really believe that the man on the stairs could
have been Fausto. Gemma would not look
twice at such a harmless infant now. When
she was forty-five, perhaps, she might smile on
boys, but at twenty-six&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>


<p>Olive sat in her little bedroom correcting
exercises.</p>

<p>It was the drowsy middle of the afternoon
and the heat was intense. All the grey-green
and golden land of Tuscany lay still and helpless
at the mercy of the sun. The birds had
long ceased singing, and only the thin shrilling
of the locusts broke the August silence. The
parched earth was pale, and great cracks that
only the autumn rains could fill had opened on
the hillsides, but the ripening maize lay snug
within its narrow sheaths of green, and the
leaves of the vines hid great bunches of purpling
grapes. In the fields men rested awhile
from their labours, and the patient white oxen
stood in the shade of the mulberries, while the
sunburnt lads who drove them bathed their
tired bodies in the stream, or lay idly in the
lush grass at the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<p>In the town the walls of houses that had
fronted the morning sun were scorching to the
touch, and there was no coolness even in the
steep northward streets that were always in
shadow, or in the grey stone-paved courts of
the palaces. There were few people about at
this hour, and the little stream of traffic had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
run dry in the Via Cavour. A vendor of
melons drew his barrow close up to the
battered old column in the Piazza Tolomei,
and squatted down on the ground beside
it. &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cocomeri! Fresc&rsquo; e buoni!</em>&rdquo; he cried
once or twice, and then rolled over and went to
sleep. A peasant girl carrying a basket of
eggs passed presently, and she looked wistfully
at the fruit, but she did not disturb his
slumbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the aunt of your friend&rsquo;s mother?
No, it is the sister of my niece&rsquo;s governess.&rdquo;
Olive laid down her pen. She was only
partially dressed and her hair hung loosely
about her bare white shoulders. The heat
made hairpins seem a burden and outer garments
superfluous. &ldquo;My niece&rsquo;s governess is
the last. Thank Heaven for that!&rdquo; she said,
and she sat down on the brick floor to take off
her stockings. Gemma&rsquo;s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fidanzato</i>, her lawyer
from Lucca, was coming to Siena for a week.
He would lodge next door and come in to the
Menotti for most of his meals, and already
poor old Carolina was busy in the hot, airless
kitchen, beating up eggs for a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">zabajone</i>,
and Signora Carosi had gone out to buy
ice for the wine and sweet cakes to be handed
round with little glasses of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vin</i> Santo or
Marsala.</p>

<p>Carmela came into her cousin&rsquo;s room soon
after four o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;I have just taken Gemma
a cup of black coffee. Her head aches
terribly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
&ldquo;I heard her moving about her room in the
night,&rdquo; Olive answered, and she added, under
her breath, &ldquo;Poor Gemma!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carmela lowered her voice too. &ldquo;Of
course Maria and I know that you see what is
going on as well as we do. There is some
man ... she lets down a basket from her
window at nights for letters, and I believe
she meets him when my aunt thinks she has
gone to Mass. It is dreadful. How glad
we shall be when she is safely married and
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! I don&rsquo;t know. Do you hear the
beating of a drum? One of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contrade</i> is
coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls ran to the window, and Olive
opened the green shutters a little way that
they might see out without being seen. The
day of the Palio was close at hand, and the
pages and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alfieri</i> of the rival parishes, whose
horses were to run in the race, were already
going about the town. Olive never tired of
watching the flash of bright colours as the
flags were flung up and deftly caught again,
and she cried out now with pleasure as the
little procession moved leisurely across the
piazza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why they come here,&rdquo; Carmela
said, as the first <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alfiero</i> let the heavy folds of
silk ripple about his head, twisted the staff,
seemed to drop it, and gathered it to him again
easily with his left hand. The page stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
aside with a grave assumption of the gilded
graces of the thirteenth century. He was
handsome in his dress of green and white and
scarlet velvet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does he look up here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive laughed a little. &ldquo;He is the son of
the cobbler who mends my boots,&rdquo; she
whispered. &ldquo;He is trying to learn English
and I have lent him some books, and that is
why he has come to do us honour. I think
it is charming of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took a white magnolia blossom from a
glass dish on her table. &ldquo;Shall I be medi&aelig;val
too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy raised smiling eyes as the pale
flower came fluttering down to him. One of
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alfieri</i> laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">O Romeo, sei bello!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Son&rsquo; felice!</em>&rdquo; he answered, and he kissed
the waxen petals ardently.</p>

<p>Olive softly clapped her hands together.
&ldquo;Is he not delicious! What an actor! Oh,
Italy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that the performance was over the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alfieri</i> strolled across the piazza to the barrow
that was still drawn up by the column.
&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cocomeri! Fresc&rsquo; e buoni!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never know what will please you,&rdquo;
Carmela said as she sat down. &ldquo;But foreigners
always like the Palio. You will see many
English and Americans and Germans on the
stands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I love it all. Yesterday I passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
through the Piazza del Campo and saw the
workmen putting palings all about the centre,
and hammering at the stands, while others
strewed sand on the course and fastened
mattresses to the side of the house by San
Martino.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fantini</i> are often thrown there and
flung against the wall. If there were no
mattresses ... crack!&rdquo; Carmela made a
sound as of breaking bones and hummed a few
bars of Chopin&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marche Fun&egrave;bre</i>.</p>

<p>Olive shuddered. &ldquo;You are an impressionist,
Carmela. Two dabs of scarlet and a
smear&mdash;half a word and a shrug of the
shoulders&mdash;and you have expressed a five-act
tragedy. I think you could act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not clever; I should never be
able to remember my part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would improvise,&rdquo; Olive was beginning,
when Carmela sprang up and ran to the
window again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Orazio!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He has come
in a cab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetturino</i> had pulled his horse up with a
jerk of the reins after the manner of his kind;
the wretched animal had slipped and he was
now beating it about the head with the butt
end of his whip. His fare had got out and was
looking on calmly.</p>

<p>Olive hastily picked up one of her shoes and
flung it at them. It struck the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetturino</i>
just above the ear. &ldquo;A nasty crack,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;His language is evidently frightful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
It is a good thing I can&rsquo;t understand it,
Carmela.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked down at the angry, bewildered
men, and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetturino</i>, catching a glimpse of
the flushed face framed in a soft fluff of brown
hair, shook his fist and roared a curse upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Touch that horse again and I&rsquo;ll throw a
jug of boiling water over you,&rdquo; she cried as
she drew the green shutters to; and then, in
quite another tone, &ldquo;Oh, Giovanni, be good.
What has the poor beast ever done to you?&rdquo;
She turned to Carmela. &ldquo;I know him. His
wife does washing for Signora Aurelia,&rdquo; she
explained.</p>

<p>A slow grin overspread the man&rsquo;s heavy
face as he rubbed his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mad English,&rdquo; he said, and then looked
closely at the coin the Lucchese had tendered
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your legal fare,&rdquo; Orazio began pompously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Santo Diavolo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Si capisce!</em> Will you give the signorina
her shoe?&rdquo; He handed it to Orazio, who took
it awkwardly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The incident is closed,&rdquo; Olive said as she
came back to her cooling tea. &ldquo;I hope there
is a heaven for horses and a hell for men.
Oh, how I hate cruelty! Carmela, if that is
Orazio I must say I sympathise with Gemma.
How could any woman love a mean, narrow-shouldered,
whitey-brown paper thing like
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; sighed Carmela as she moved
towards the door. &ldquo;But after all they are all
alike in the end. I must go now to help Maria
lace. I pull a little, and then wait a few
minutes. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">&Egrave; un martirio!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does she do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does an ostrich bury its head in the
sand? Why does a camel try to get through
the eye of a needle? (But perhaps he does
not.) I often tell her fat cannot be hidden,
but she will not believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Olive went into the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">salotto</i> a few
minutes before seven she found the family
assembled. Signor Lucis rose from his place
at Gemma&rsquo;s side as the aunt uttered the
introductory formula. He brought his heels
together and bowed stiffly from the waist,
and when Olive gave him her hand in English
fashion he took it limply and held it for a
moment before he dropped it. His string-coloured
moustache was brushed up from a
loose-lipped mouth, and he showed bad teeth
when he smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The signorina speaks Italian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, does she come from London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no settled home in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! The sun never shines there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;Not as it does here,&rdquo; she
admitted. &ldquo;Where is my shoe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was yours then?&rdquo; he said with an
attempt at playfulness. &ldquo;Gemma has been
quite jealous of the unknown owner, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
says it is much larger than any of hers.&rdquo; The
girls&rsquo; eyes met but neither spoke, and Orazio
babbled on, unheeding: &ldquo;Her feet are <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carini</i>,
and I can span her ankle with my thumb and
forefinger; but you are small made too,
signorina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carolina poked her head in at the door.
&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Al suo comodo &egrave; pronto</i>,&rdquo; she said, referring
to the dinner, and hurried away again to dish
up the veal cutlets.</p>

<p>The young man contrived to remain behind
in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">salotto</i> for a moment and to keep Gemma
with him. Olive looked at them as they took
their places at table, and she understood that
the girl had had to submit to some caress.
She looked sick and her lips were quite white,
and if Lucis had been a man of quick perceptions
he would have realised, her face must
have shown him, that she loathed him. He
was dense, however, and though he commented
on her silence later on it was evident that he
attributed it to shyness.</p>

<p>Olive, thinking to do well, flung herself into
the conversational breach. Her cousins had
nothing to say, and the aunt&rsquo;s thoughts were
set on the dinner and cumbered with much
serving. So she talked to him as in duty
bound, and he seemed inclined to banter her.</p>

<p>Her feet, her temper, her relations with
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetturini</i>. He was execrable, but she would
not take offence.</p>

<p>After dinner they all sat in the little <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">salotto</i>
until it was time to go to the theatre, and still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Olive talked and laughed with Orazio, teaching
him English words and making fun of his pronunciation
of them. Gemma watched her
sombrely and judged her by her own standards,
and Carmela caught at her cousin&rsquo;s arm
presently as they passed down the crowded
Via Cavour together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you make her so angry? She
will always hate you now. I did not know
you were <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">civetta</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive looked startled. &ldquo;Angry? What do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you speak so much to Orazio?
Gemma thought you wanted to take her
husband from her and she will not forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I could see it made her ill to look
at him and that she shrank from his touch, and
I did as I would be done by. I distracted his
attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carmela laughed in spite of herself. &ldquo;Oh,
Olive, and I thought you were so clever. Do
you not understand that one can be jealous of
a man one does not love? I know that though
I am stupid. All Italians are jealous. You
must remember that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Olive said ruefully after a
pause. &ldquo;I see you are right. She will never
believe that I wanted to help her. If only you
could persuade her to give up Orazio. Surely
the other man would come forward then. You
and Maria talk of getting her safely married
and away, but I see farther. There can be no
safety in union with the wrong man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Carmela shook her head. &ldquo;She wants a
husband,&rdquo; she said stolidly, &ldquo;and Orazio will
make a good one. You do not understand us,
my dear. You can please yourself with
dreams and fancies, but we are different.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>


<p>Olive was careful to sit down with Carmela
on one side of their box on the second tier,
leaving two chairs in front for the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fidanzati</i>,
but the young man made several efforts to
include her in the conversation and she understood
that she had put herself in a false
position. Orazio had misunderstood her
because her manners were not the manners of
Lucca, and he knew no others. It annoyed
her to see that he plumed himself on his conquest,
but her sense of humour enabled her to
avoid his glances with a good grace, especially
as she realised that she had brought them on
herself.</p>

<p>She felt nothing but pity for her cousin now.
It would be terrible to marry a man like that,
she thought, and she wondered that so many
women could rush in where angels feared to
tread. She believed that there were infinite
possibilities of happiness in the holy state of
matrimony, but it seemed to her that perhaps
the less said of some actualities the better.</p>

<p>Carmela was right. At this time she
pastured on dreams and fancies. Her
emotions were not starved, but they were
kept down and only allowed to nibble. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
thought often of the man who had been kind
to her, and sometimes she wished that he had
kissed her. It would have been something to
remember. Often, if she closed her eyes, she
could almost cheat herself into believing him
there close beside her, his brown gaze upon her,
his lips quivering with a strange eagerness
that troubled her and yet made her glad.
Jean Avenel. It was a good name.</p>

<p>He had gone to America and she assured
herself that he must have forgotten her, but
she did not try to forget him. She nursed
the little wistful sorrow for what might
have been, as women will, and would not
bind up the scratch he had inflicted. Already
she had learned that some pain is
pleasant, and that a stinging sweetness may
be distilled from tears. Sometimes at night,
when it was too hot to sleep and she lay
watching the fine silver lines of moonlight passing
across the floor, she asked herself if she
would see him again, and when, and how, and
wove all manner of cobweb fancies about what
might be.</p>

<p>She ripened quickly as fruit ripens in the
hot sunshine of Italy; her lips were more
sweetly curved and coloured, and her blue
eyes were shadowed now. They were like
sapphires seen through a veil.</p>

<p>Maria gave her the opera-glasses and she
raised them to scan the house. It was a gala
night and the theatre was hung with flags and
brilliantly illuminated. There were candles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
everywhere, and the great chandelier that hung
from the ceiling was lit. The heat was stifling,
and the incessant fluttering of fans gave the
women in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parterre</i> and in the crowded
boxes a look of unrest that was belied by their
placid, expressionless faces. Many glanced up
at the Menotti in their box. There was some
criticism of Gemma&rsquo;s Lucchese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is ugly, but she could not expect to get
a husband here where she is so well known.
They say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Capuan Psyche and a rose from the
garden of Eden,&rdquo; said a man in the stage box,
who had discerned Olive&rsquo;s fresh, eager prettiness
beyond the pale beauty of the Odalisque.</p>

<p>He handed the glasses to his neighbour.
&ldquo;Choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Paris is a thankless one; it
involved death in the end for the shepherd
prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are not a shepherd prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man addressed was handsome as a faun
might be and as a tiger is. Not sleek, but
lean and brown, with hot, insolent eyes and a
fine and cruel mouth. A great emerald
sparkled on the little finger of his left hand.
He was one of the few in the house who wore
evening dress, and he was noticeable on that
account, but he had been standing talking
with some other men at the back of his box
hitherto. He came forward now and Gemma
saw him. Her set lips relaxed and seemed to
redden as she met his bold, lifted gaze, but as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
his eyes left hers and he raised his glasses to
stare past her at Olive her face contracted
so that for the moment she was almost ugly.</p>

<p>The performance was timed to begin at nine,
but at twenty minutes past the hour newsvendors
were still going to and fro with bundles
of evening papers, and the orchestra was represented
by a melancholy bald-headed man with
a cornet. The other musicians came in
leisurely, one by one, and at last the conductor
took his place and the audience settled
down and was comparatively quiet while the
Royal March was being played. The orchestra
had begun the overture to <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Rigoletto</i> when some
of the men who stood in the packed arena
behind the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">palchi</i> cried out and their friends in
other parts of the house joined in. They
howled like wolves, and for a few minutes the
uproar was terrific, and Verdi&rsquo;s music was
overwhelmed by the clamour of voices until
the conductor, turning towards the audience,
said something inaudible with a deprecating
bow and a quick movement of his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ora, zitti!</em>&rdquo; yelled a voice from the
gallery.</p>

<p>Silence was instant, and the whole house rose
and stood reverently, listening to a weird and
confused jumble of broken chords that yet
could stir the pulses and quicken the beating
of young hearts.</p>

<p>Olive had risen with the rest. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
she whispered to Maria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Garibaldi&rsquo;s Hymn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
It seemed a red harmony of rebellious souls,
climbing, struggling, clutching at the skirts of
Freedom. The patter of spent shot, the
heavy breathing of hunted fugitives, the
harsh crying of dying men, the rush of feet
that stumbled as they came over the graves
of the Past; all these sounds of bygone strife
rang, as it were, faintly, beyond the strange
music, as the sea echoes, sighing, in a
shell.</p>

<p>Signora Aurelia had told Olive how in the
years before Italy was free and united under the
king, when Guiseppe Verdi was a young man,
the students would call his name in the theatre
until the house rang to the cry of &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viva
Verdi! Viva Verdi!</em>&rdquo; A little because they
loved their music-maker, more because V.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;I.
meant Vittor Emanuele, Re D&rsquo;Italia,
and they liked to sing his forbidden praises
in the very ears of the white-coat Austrians.</p>

<p>They had their Victor. Had he not
sufficed? Olive knew that the authorities
scarcely countenanced the playing of the
Republican hymn. Was it because it made
men long for some greater ruler than a king, or
for no ruler at all? Freedom is more elusive
even than happiness. Never yet has she
yielded herself to men, though she makes large
promises and exacts sacrifices as cruel as ever
those of Moloch could have been. Her altars
stream with blood, but she ... she is talking,
or she is pursuing, or she is on a journey, or
peradventure she sleepeth ... and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
prophets must still call upon her and cut themselves
with knives.</p>

<p>As the curtain went up Olive leant forward
that she might see the stage. It was her first
opera. Music is a necessity in Italy, but in
England it is a luxury, and somehow she and
her mother had never been able to afford even
seats in the gallery at Covent Garden.</p>

<p>Now all her thoughts, all her fancies, were
swept away in the flood of charming melody.
The story, when she understood it, shocked
and repelled her. It seemed strange that
crime should be set to music, and that one
should have to see abduction, treachery, vice,
and a murder brutally committed in full view
of the audience, while the tenor sang the
lightest of all his lyrics: &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La donna &egrave; mobile</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemma asked for an ice during the second
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr&rsquo;acte</i>, and Orazio hurried out to get one for
her at the buffet. The girl looked tired,
but she was kind to her lover in her silent,
languid way, listening to his whispered
inanities, and allowing him to hold her hand,
though her flesh shrank from the damp clamminess
of his grasp, and she hated his nearness
and wished him away.</p>

<p>The man who sat alone now in the stage
box could see no flaw in her composure, and she
seemed to him as perfectly calm as she was
perfectly beautiful, though he had noticed
that not once had she looked towards the stage.
She kept her eyes down, and they were
shadowed by the long black lashes. Ah, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was beautiful! The man&rsquo;s lean brown face
was troubled and he sighed under his breath.
He went out in the middle of the third act,
and he did not come back again.</p>

<p>After a while Gemma moved restlessly.
&ldquo;Orazio, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">per carit&agrave;</i>! Your hand is so hot and
sticky! I shall change places with Carmela,&rdquo;
she said. She released her fingers from the
young man&rsquo;s grasp with the air of one crushing
a forward insect or removing a bramble from
the path, and she actually beckoned to her
sister to come.</p>

<p>Orazio flushed red and he seemed about to
speak as Carmela rose from her seat, but the
aunt interposed hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit still, Gemma, you are tired or you
would not speak so. The lights hurt your
eyes and make your head ache.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am tired,&rdquo; the girl said wearily.
&ldquo;I slept ill last night. Forgive me, Orazio,
if I was cross. I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her dull submission touched Olive with a
sudden sense of pity and of fear, but Orazio
was blind and deaf to all things written
between the lines of life, and he could not
interpret it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not always understand you,&rdquo; he said
stiffly, and he would not relax until presently
she drew nearer to him of her own accord.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>


<p>The Vicolo dei Moribondi is the narrowest of
all the steep stone-paved streets that lead from
the upper town to the market-place of Siena,
and the great red bulk of the Palazzo Pubblico
overshadows it. Olive had come that way
once from the Porta Romana, and seeing the
legend: &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Affitasi una camera</i>&rdquo; displayed in
the doorway of one of the shabby houses, had
been moved to climb the many stairs to see the
room in question.</p>

<p>It proved to be a veritable eyrie, large, bare,
passably clean, and very well lighted. From
the window she saw the hillside below the
church of San Giuseppe, a huddle of red
roofs and grey olive orchards melting into a
blue haze of distance beyond the city walls,
and the crowning heights of San Quirico.
Leaning out over the sill of crumbling stone
she looked down into the Vicolo as into a well.</p>

<p>The rent was very low, and the woman who
had the room to let seemed a decent though a
frowsy old soul, and so the matter was settled
there and then, and Olive had left the house
with the key of her new domain in her pocket.</p>

<p>She had bought a table and two chairs and
a shelf for her books at a second-hand furniture
shop near the Duomo, and had given her first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
lesson there two days later, and soon the quiet
place seemed more like home to her than the
stuffy flat in the Piazza Tolomei. What
matter if she came to it breathless from climbing
five flights of stairs? It was good to be
high up above the stale odours of the streets.
The window was always open. There were no
woollen mats to be faded or waxen fruits to
be melted by the sun&rsquo;s heat. A little plaster
bust of Dante stood on the table, and Olive
kept the flowers her pupils gave her, pink
oleander blossoms and white roses from the
terrace gardens, in a jar of majolica ware, but
otherwise the place was unadorned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is like a convent,&rdquo; Carmela said when
she came there with Maria and her aunt for an
English tea-drinking.</p>

<p>Signora Carosi had sipped a little tea and
eaten a good many of the cakes Olive had
bought from the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pasticceria</i>. &ldquo;The situation
is impossible,&rdquo; she remarked, as she brushed
the crumbs off her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stairs are a drawback,&rdquo; Olive admitted,
not without malice, &ldquo;but fortunately
my pupils are all young and strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are English. I always say that when
I am asked how I can permit such things.
&lsquo;What would you? She teaches men grammar
alone in an attic. I cannot help it. She is
English.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemma had been asked to come too on this
occasion, but she had excused herself. She so
often had headaches when the others were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
going out, and they would leave her lying
down in her room. When they came back she
was always up and better, and yet she seemed
feverish and strange. Then sometimes of a
morning, when Maria and the aunt had gone
out marketing, and Carmela, shapeless and
dishevelled in her white cotton jacket, was
dusting or ironing, the beautiful idle sister
would come out of her room, dressed for the
street and carrying a prayer-book. Carmela
would remonstrate with her. &ldquo;You are not
going alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only to mass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morning of the fifteenth of August
she did not go with the others to the parish
church at six o&rsquo;clock, but she was up early,
nevertheless. She wrote a letter, and presently,
having sealed it, she dropped it out of
the window. A boy who had been lingering
about the piazza since dawn, and staring up at
the close-shuttered fronts of the tall houses,
picked it up and ran off with it. When Maria
and Carmela came back with their aunt soon
after seven they drank their black coffee in the
kitchen before going to their rooms to rest.
Carolina took Olive&rsquo;s breakfast in to her on a
tray when they were gone. The English girl
had milk with her coffee and some slices of
bread spread with rancid butter. Gemma
lay in wait for the old woman and stopped her
as she came from the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find out what she is going to do to-day,&rdquo;
she whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Carolina nodded and her shrivelled monkey
face was puckered into a smile. She came
back presently. &ldquo;She is going to the Duomo
and then to <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">colazione</i> with the De Sancti.
She will go with Signora Aurelia to see the
Palio and only come back here to supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemma went back to her room to finish her
dressing. She put on a pink muslin frock and
a hat of white straw wreathed with roses and
leaves. Surely her beauty should avail to give
her all she desired, light and warmth always,
diamonds and fine laces, and silks to clothe
her and give her grace, and the possession of
the one man&rsquo;s heart, with his name and a place
in the world beside him. Surely she was not
destined to live with Orazio and his tiresome
mother, penned up in a shabby little house in
Lucca, and there growing old and hideous.
She sat before her glass thinking these thoughts
and waiting until she heard Olive&rsquo;s quick, light
step in the passage and then the opening and
shutting of the front door. Carolina was in
the kitchen and the others had gone to lie
down, but she went into the dining-room and
listened for a moment there before she ventured
into her cousin&rsquo;s room. She had often
been in to pry when alone in the flat, and she
knew where to look for the key of the attic in
the Vicolo. Olive always kept it in a corner
of the table drawer and it was there now.
Gemma smiled her rare slow smile as she put
it in her purse. There was a photograph of her
aunt&mdash;Olive&rsquo;s mother&mdash;on the dressing-table,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and a Tauchnitz edition of Swinburne&rsquo;s <i>Atalanta
in Calydon</i> lay beside it, the embroidered
tassel of the marker being one of Astorre&rsquo;s
pitiful little gifts. She swept them off on to
the floor and poured the contents of the ink-stand
over them. She had acted on a spiteful
impulse, and she was half afraid when she saw
the black stream trickling over the book and
blotting out the face of the woman who had
been of her kin. It seemed unlucky, a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">malore</i>,
and she was vexed with herself. She looked
into the kitchen on her way out. &ldquo;Carolina,
if they ask where I am I have gone to church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman nodded. &ldquo;Very well, signorina,
but you are becoming too devout.
<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bada, figlia mia!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Siena is a city dedicated to the Virgin, and
the feast of her Assumption is the greatest of
all her red-letter days. The streets had
echoed at dawn to the feet of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contadini</i> coming
in by the Porta Romana, the Porta Camollia,
the Porta Pespini. The oxen had been fed and
left in their stalls; there was no ploughing in
the fields on this day, no gathering of figs, no
sound of singing voices and laughter in the
vineyards. The brown wrinkled old men and
women, the lithe, slender youths in their suits
of black broadcloth&mdash;wood gods disguised by
cheap tailoring&mdash;all had left their work and
come many a mile along the dusty roads
and across fields to the town for the dear
Madonna&rsquo;s sake, and to see the Palio. The
country girls had all new dresses for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ferragosto</i> and they strutted in the Via Cavour
like little pigeons pluming themselves in the
sunshine. They were nearly all pretty, and
the flapping hats of Tuscan straw half hid and
half revealed charming curves of cheek and
chin, little tip-tilted noses, soft brown eyes.
Many of the townsfolk were out too on this
day of days and the streets were crowded with
gay, vociferous people. There was so much to
see. The old picture-gallery was free to all,
and the very beggars might go in to see the
sly, pale, almond-eyed Byzantine Madonne in
their gilt frames, and Sodoma&rsquo;s tormented
Christ at the Pillar with the marks of French
bullets in the plaster. All the palaces too were
hung with arras, flags fluttered everywhere,
church bells were ringing.</p>

<p>Gemma passed down a side street and
went a little out of her way to avoid the
Piazza del Campo, but she had to cross the
Via Ricasoli, and the crowd was so dense there
that she was forced to stand on a doorstep
for a while before she could get by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they all staring at?&rdquo; she asked
impatiently of a woman near her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the horse of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Montone</i>! They are
taking him to be blessed at the parish church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor animal was led by the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fantino</i> who
was to ride him in the race, and followed by
the page. He was small and lean and grey,
with outstanding ribs and the dry scar of an
old wound on his flank. The people eyed him
curiously. &ldquo;An ugly beast!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
you should see him run when the cognac is in
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemma began to be afraid that she would
be late, and that He might find the door shut
and go away again, and she pushed her way
through the crowd and hurried down the
Vicolo and into the house numbered thirteen.
She was very breathless, being tightly laced
and unused to so many stairs, and she
stumbled a little as she crossed the threshold.
She was glad to sit down on one of the chairs
by the open window. The bare room no
longer seemed conventual now that its unaccustomed
air was stirred by the movement of
her fan and tainted by the faint scent of her
violet powder.</p>

<p>Outside, in the market-place, the country
women were sitting in the shade of their
enormous red and blue striped umbrellas
beside their stalls of fruit, while the people who
came to buy moved to and fro from one to the
other, beating down prices, chaffering eagerly
with little cries of &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Per carit&agrave;!</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio
mio!</em>&rdquo; shrugging their shoulders, moving
away, until at last the peasants would abate
their price by one soldo. A clinking of coppers
followed, and the green peaches and small black
figs would be pushed into a string bag with a
bit of meat wrapped in a back number of the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vedetta Senese</i>, a half kilo of <i>pasta</i>, and perhaps
a tiny packet of snuff from the shop
where they sell salt and tobacco and picture
postcards of the Pope and La Bella Otero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
In the old days the scaffold and the gallows
had been set up there, and the Street of the
Dying had earned its name then, so many
doomed wretches had passed down it from the
Justice Hall and the prisons to the place of
expiation. Weighed down by chains they had
gone reluctantly, dragging their feet upon
their last journey, trying to listen to the
priest&rsquo;s droning of prayers, or to see some
friendly face in the crowd.</p>

<p>The memory of old sorrows and torments lay
heavy sometimes here on those who had eyes
to see and ears to hear the things of the past,
and Olive was often pitifully aware of the
Moribondi. Rain had streamed down their
haggard faces, washing their tears away, the
sun had shone upon them, dazzling their tired
eyes as they turned the corner where the cobbler
had his stall now, and came to the place from
whence they might have their first glimpse
of the scaffold. Poor frightened souls! But
Gemma knew nothing of them, and she would
have cared nothing if she had known. She
was not imaginative, and her own ills and the
present absorbed her, since now she heard the
man&rsquo;s step upon the stair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come then,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>He made no answer, but he put his arms
about her, holding her close, and kissed her
again and again.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Filippo! Let me go! Let me breathe,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carissimo</i>! I want to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not seem to hear her. He had
drawn the long steel pins out of her hat and had
thrown the pretty thing down on the floor,
and the loosened coils of shining hair fell over
his hands as his strong lips bruised the pale,
flower-like curves of her mouth.</p>

<p>Filippo had loved many women in the only
way possible to him, and they had been won
by his brutality and his insolence, and by the
glamour of his name. The annals of medi&aelig;val
Italy were stained with blood and tears
because of the Tor di Rocca, and their loves
that ended always in cruelty and horror, and
Filippo had all the instincts of his decadent
race. In love he was pitiless; no impulses of
tenderness or of chivalry restrained him, and
his methods were primeval and violent.
Probably the Rape of the Sabines was his ideal
of courtship, but the subsequent domesticity,
the settling down of the Romans with their
stolen wives, would have been less to his taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Filippo!&rdquo; Gemma cried again, and this
time he let her go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may breathe for one minute,&rdquo; he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
looking at his watch. &ldquo;There is not much
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew the chair towards the table and
sat down. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said imperatively,
but she shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Filippo, I love you, but you must
listen. Did you see my <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fidanzato</i> in our box
at the theatre last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I am glad he is so ugly. I shall
not be jealous. You must give me your
address in Lucca,&rdquo; he said coolly.</p>

<p>Her face fell. &ldquo;You will let me marry him?
You&mdash;you do not mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a grimace. &ldquo;I do not like it, but
I cannot help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he makes me sick,&rdquo; she said tremulously.
&ldquo;I hate him to touch me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed that her words lit some fire in
him. His hot eyes sparkled as he stretched
out his arms to her. &ldquo;Ah, come to me now
then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood still by the table watching him
fearfully. &ldquo;Filippo, I hoped&mdash;I thought you
would take me away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible. I cannot even see you
again until after Christmas. It will be safer&mdash;better
not. But in January I will come to
Lucca, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated, weighing his words, weighing
his thought and his desire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her closely, deliberately,
divining the beauty that was half hidden from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
him. Her parted lips were lovely, and the
texture of her white skin was satin smooth as
the petals of a rose; there was no fault in the
pure oval of her face, in the line of her black
brows. He could see no flaw in her now, and
he believed that she would still seem unsurpassably
fair after a lapse of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if you still wish it, I will take you
away. You shall have a villa at San Remo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, and she
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>She had hoped to be the Princess Tor di
Rocca, and he had offered to keep her still as
his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">amica</i>. Presently, if she wished it and it
still suited him, he would set her feet on the
way that led to the streets. &ldquo;Then if you
wish it&mdash;&rdquo; To her the insult seemed to lie in
the proposed delay. She loved him, and she
had no love for virtue. She loved him, and
if he had urged her to go with him on the
instant she would have yielded easily. But
she must await his convenience; next year,
perhaps; and meanwhile she must go to
Lucca, she must be married to the other man.</p>

<p>She was crying, and tears oozed out between
her fingers and dripped on the floor. &ldquo;He is
horrible to me,&rdquo; she said brokenly.</p>

<p>Filippo rose then and came to her; he loved
her in his way, and she moved him as no
woman had done yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why need you marry him? Do not.
Wait for me here and I will surely come for
you,&rdquo; he said as he drew her to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
She hid her face on his shoulder. &ldquo;I dare
not send him away,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;All
Siena would laugh at me, and I should be
ashamed to be seen. No other man would
ever take me after such a scandal. Besides,
you know I must be married. You know
that, Filippo! And if you did not
come&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clung to him in silence for a while before
she spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not until January?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be good if I tell you?&rdquo; he asked
when he had kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; only hold me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gemma, you must know that I am poor.
I have told you often how the palace in
Florence is shabby, eaten up with moth and
rust. The Villa at Certaldo is falling into
ruins too. I am poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have an automobile, servants, horses;
you stay here at the best hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not be poor for a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contadino</i> but I
am for a prince,&rdquo; he said impatiently and with
emphasis. &ldquo;Believe me, I want money, and I
must have it. I cannot steal it or earn it, or
win it in the lottery unfortunately, so I must
marry it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cowered down as though he had struck
her, and made an effort to escape from him,
but he held her fast. She tried to speak, but
the pain in her throat prevented her from
uttering an articulate sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do not think of the woman,&rdquo; he said
hurriedly. &ldquo;You need not. I do not. Once
I am married I shall go my own way, of
course, but her father is in Naples now, and
he is a tiresome old fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santissimo Dio!</em>&rdquo; she gasped presently.
&ldquo;When&mdash;when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In December.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed as he gave the answer she hoped
for. &ldquo;She is an American,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and
it sets one&rsquo;s teeth on edge to hear her trying
to talk Italian. Her accent! She is a small
dry thing like a grasshopper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish she was dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He set himself to soothe and comfort her,
but it was not easy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might as well be ugly,&rdquo; she cried again
and again.</p>

<p>It was the simple expression of her defeat.
The beauty she had held to be a shield against
sorrow and a key to the garden of delights was
but a poor thing after all. It had not availed
her, and she had nothing else. She was
stripped now, naked, alone and defenceless in a
hard world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carissima</i>, be still. Have patience. I
love you, and I shall come for you,&rdquo; whispered
Tor di Rocca, and she tried to believe him,
and to persuade herself that the flame in his
brown eyes would burn for her always.</p>

<p>Slowly, as the passion of grief ebbed, the
tide of love rose in her and flushed her wan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
tear-stained face and made it beautiful. The
door of the room was opened, but neither she
nor the man heard it, or saw it closed again.
It was their last hour, this bare room was their
world and they were alone in it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>


<p>The table was set for lunch out on the terrace
where Astorre lay gazing upon his Tuscany,
veiled in a shimmering haze of heat and
crowned with August blue. The best coffee
cups of majolica ware had been set out, and
signora had made a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">zabajone</i> in honour of
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ferragosto</i>. It was meant to please Olive, who
was childishly fond of its thick yellow sweetness,
but she seemed restless and depressed;
Astorre looked ill, and his mother&rsquo;s eyes were
anxious as they dwelt on him, and so the
dainty was eaten in silence, and passed away
unhonoured and unsung as though it were
humble pie or a funeral baked meat.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon, when the signora had
gone to lie down, Astorre began to ask questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your face hot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;what makes you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are flushed,&rdquo; he said bluntly, &ldquo;and
you will not meet my eyes. Why? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I cannot
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The haggard, aquiline face changed and
hardened. &ldquo;Someone has been rude to you,
or has frightened you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She moved away to escape the inquisition
of his eyes. &ldquo;Some of these plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
want water. I shall fetch some.&rdquo; She was
going in when he called to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olive,&rdquo; he said haltingly. &ldquo;Perhaps we
ought to have told you before. My mother
heard of some people who want an English
governess from a friend of hers who is a music
mistress in Florence. They are rich and
would pay well, and we should have told you
when we heard of it, three days ago, but I could
not bear the thought of your leaving Siena
while&mdash;while I am still here. But if those
people in the Piazza Tolomei are unkind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came back then and sat down beside
him. &ldquo;I do not want to leave Siena,&rdquo; she
said gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he answered, and added:
&ldquo;It will not be for long. Why should I pretend
to you?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I have suffered,
but now I have no pain at all, only I am very
weak. Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held up his hand; it was yellowish white
and so thin as to be almost transparent, and it
seemed to Olive to be most pathetic because
it was not very small or very finely made. It
held the broken promise of power, she thought
sorrowfully, and she stroked the outstretched
palm gently as though it were a half-frozen
bird that she would bring to life again.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, smiling. &ldquo;Ah, your
little fingers are soft and warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were at the theatre last night,&rdquo; he
said presently. &ldquo;Fausto saw you. How do
you like your cousin&rsquo;s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fidanzato</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olive, do you know that they say strange
things about the Odalisque? I am afraid there
will be trouble if her Lucchese hears&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care to hear that nickname,&rdquo;
she said coldly. &ldquo;It is impertinent and
absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do not let go of my hand,&rdquo; he implored.
&ldquo;Keep on stroking it. I love it! I
love it! If I were a cat you would hear me
purring. Tell me about England and Shakespeare
and Shelley. Anything. I will be
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have not brought the book I promised
you. I would have fetched it on my
way here, but&mdash;but I had not the key. I am
sorry, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nino</i>. Yes, let us talk of nice things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was quick to relent, and soon seemed to
be herself again, and he kept his fever-bright
eyes on her, watching her as in the old days
men may have watched the stars as they
waited for the dawn that was to see them pass
by the Vicolo dei Moribondi.</p>

<p>Soon, very soon, Signora Aurelia would
come out to them, and she would stay beside
her son while Olive went to put on her hat,
and then they would say &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Addio</i>&rdquo; and leave
him. And perhaps he would indeed go to
God, or to some place where he would see the
dear ones no more. The boy&rsquo;s beautiful lips
were shut close, but the grey eyes darkened
and dilated painfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Astorre! Are you ill? Do not look so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Oh, I will not go to the Palio. I will stay with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you must go, and to-morrow you can
tell me all about it. But will you kiss me
now? Do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not ask twice, dear Astorre,&rdquo;
she whispered, as she leant over him and
touched his forehead with her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ma che!</em>&rdquo; he said ungratefully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
nothing. Kiss me properly and at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the boy&rsquo;s mother came out on to the
terrace a moment later Olive&rsquo;s blue eyes were
full of tears and the rose flush of her cheeks
had deepened, but she looked at her friend very
kindly as she uttered the word he had been
afraid to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Addio!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Piazza del Campo was crowded as the
Signora Aurelia and Olive passed through it to
their seats on the second best stand, and the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri</i> were clearing the course. The
thousands of people in the central space, who
had been chewing melon seeds, fanning themselves,
and talking vociferously as they waited,
grew quieter, and all began to look one way
towards the narrow street from whence the
procession should appear.</p>

<p>Olive sat wedged between Signora Aurelia
and an old country priest whose shabby
soutane was stained with the mud his housekeeper
should have brushed off after the last
rains, a fortnight before. He had a kind, worn
face that smiled when Olive helped him put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his cotton umbrella in a safe place between
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not need it yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
there is a storm coming. Do you not feel the
heaviness of the air, and the heat, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio mio</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The deep bell of the Mangia tower tolled,
and then the signal was given, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">un colpo di
mortaletto</i>, and the pageant began.</p>

<p>Slowly they came, the grave, armoured
knights riding with their visors up that all
might see how well the tanner, Giovanni, and
Enrico Lupi of the wine-shop, looked in chain
mail; gay, velvet-clad pages carrying the silk-embroidered
standards of their <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrade</i> with
all the fine airs of the lads who stand about the
bier of Saint Catherine in Ghirlandaio&rsquo;s fresco
in the Duomo; lithe, slender <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alfieri</i> tossing
their flags, twisting them about in the carefully-concerted
movements that look so easy and
are so difficult, until the whole great Piazza
was girdled with fluttering light and colour,
while it echoed to the thrilling and disquieting
beat of the drums. Each <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i> had its
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tamburino</i>, and each <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tamburino</i> beat upon his
drum incessantly until his arms tired and the
sweat poured down his face.</p>

<p>Olive&rsquo;s head began to ache, but she was
excited and happy, enjoying the spectacle as
a child enjoys its first pantomime, not thinking
but feeling, and steeping her senses in the
southern glow and gaiety that was all about
her. For the moment her cousin&rsquo;s shame and
sorrow, and her friend&rsquo;s pain seemed old,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
unhappy, far-off things, and she could not
realise them here.</p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i> of the Oca was the last to go by;
it was a favourite with the people because its
colours were those of the Italian flag, red,
white and green, and the Evvivas broke out as
it passed. Olive&rsquo;s page, her cobbler&rsquo;s son,
looked gravely up at her as he went by, and
she smiled at him and was glad to see that he
still wore the magnolia bud she had thrown him
in his hood of parti-coloured silk.</p>

<p>Presently they were all seated&mdash;the knights
and pages with their standard-bearers and
esquires&mdash;on their own stand in the place of
honour before the great central gates of the
Palazzo Pubblico.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the horses will run,&rdquo; explained the
signora. &ldquo;Many people like this part best,
but I do not. Poor beasts! They are half
drunk, and they are often hurt or killed. The
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fantini</i> lash at each other with their hide
whips. Once I saw the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Montone</i> strike the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lupa</i> just as they passed here; the crimson
flashed out across his face, and in his pain he
pulled his horse aside, and it fell heavily
against the palings and threw him so that the
horse of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bruco</i> coming on behind could not
avoid going over him. They said it was
terrible to see that livid weal across his mouth
as he lay in his coffin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ma! Sicuro!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive looked up at the window where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Menotti should have been, and saw strange
faces there. They had not come then. They
had not, and Astorre could not. Astorre was
very ill ... the times were out of joint. Her
cousin&rsquo;s shame and sorrow and her friend&rsquo;s
pain seemed to come near again, and to be
once more a part of her life, and she saw &ldquo;gold
tarnished, and the grey above the green.&rdquo;
When the horses came clattering by, urged by
their riders, maddened by the roar of the
crowd, she tried to shut her eyes, but she could
not. The horse of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dragone</i> stumbled at
the turn by San Martino and the rider was
thrown, and another fell by the Chigi palace
as they came round the second time. Olive
covered her face with her hands. The thin,
panting flanks, marked with half-healed scars
and stained with sweat, the poor broken
knees, the strained, suffering eyes ...</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ill, signorina?&rdquo; the old priest
asked kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but the poor horses&mdash;I cannot look.
Who has won?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose to his feet. &ldquo;The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Oca</i>!&rdquo; he cried
excitedly. A great roar of voices acclaimed
the favourite&rsquo;s victory, and when the spent
horse came to a standstill the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fantino</i> slipped
off its back and was instantly surrounded by
men and boys of his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i>, dancing and
shouting with joy, kissing him on both cheeks,
pulling him this way and that, until the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri</i>
came up and took him away amongst
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
&ldquo;The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bruco</i> hoped to win,&rdquo; the priest said,
&ldquo;and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Oca&rsquo;s fantino</i> might get a knife in
his back if he were not taken care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Already the crowd was dispersing. The
victorious <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrada</i> had been given the painted
standard of the Palio, and were bearing it in
triumph to the parish church, where it would
remain until the next <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ferragosto</i>. The others
were going their separate ways, pages and
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alfieri</i> in silk doublets and parti-coloured hosen
arm-in-arm with their friends in black broadcloth,
standard-bearers smoking cigarettes,
knights unhelmed and wiping heated brows
with red cotton handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go down the Via Ricasoli with you,&rdquo;
Olive said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I who should take you home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do not mind the crowd, and I know
you are anxious to get back to Astorre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Astorre&mdash;yes. Olive, you don&rsquo;t think he
looks more delicate, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl felt that she could not have
answered truly if her life had depended on her
veracity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is rather tired, I
think. The heat tries him. He will be better
later on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor mother seemed relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right; he is always pale in the
summer,&rdquo; she said, trying to persuade herself
that it was so. &ldquo;You will come to-morrow
to tell him about the Palio?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, surely.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
There were to be fireworks later on at the
Fortezza and illuminations of the Lizza
gardens, so the human tide set that way and
left the outlying parts of the city altogether.
The quiet, tree-shadowed piazzetta before the
church of Santa Maria dei Servi was quite
deserted. Children played there in the
mornings, and old men and women lingered
there and sat on the wooden benches in the
sun, but they were all away now; the bells
had rung for the Ave Maria, the church doors
were closed, and the sacristan had gone to his
supper.</p>

<p>A little mist had crept up from the valley;
steep red roofs and old walls that had glowed
in the sun&rsquo;s last rays were shadowed as the
light waned, and black clouds came up from
the horizon and blotted out the stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go home quickly now, Olive. There will
be a storm. The poor mad people will howl
to-night in the Manicomio. I hear them
sometimes when I am lying awake. Good-night,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive was tired, and now that she was alone
she knew that she was also a little afraid, so
that she lingered on the way and went slowly
up the stairs of the house in the Piazza Tolomei.
Carmela answered her ring at the bell; her
face was swollen and her eyes were red with
crying, and the little lamp she carried shook
in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Olive,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Orazio says he will
not marry her. He has heard such things
about her from his friends, and even in the
Caf&eacute; Greco.... It is a scandal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her lamp down on the floor, and
took out her handkerchief to wipe away the
tears that were running down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Olive came in and shut the door after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are all in the dining-room. Aunt
sent Carolina out for the evening, and it is a
good thing, because of course in the kitchen
she could hear everything. He sent a message
to say he could not go to the Palio, and
Gemma&rsquo;s head ached when she came back from
church, so we all stayed in. He came half an
hour ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does Gemma say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. She looks like a stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
&ldquo;I must go through the dining-room to get
to my room,&rdquo; Olive said uncertainly. &ldquo;What
shall I do? Pass through very quickly or
wait here in the passage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better go in,&rdquo; advised Carmela. &ldquo;They
may not even notice you. He keeps on talking
so loudly, and aunt and Maria are crying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor things! I am so sorry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls clung together for a moment,
and Olive&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears as she kissed
her cousin&rsquo;s poor trembling lips. Then Carmela
stooped to pick up her lamp and put it
out, and they went on together down the
passage.</p>

<p>The lamp was lit on the table that Carolina
had laid for supper before she went out, and
the Menotti sat in their accustomed places as
though they were at a meal. Orazio Lucis
was walking to and fro and gesticulating. His
boots creaked, and the noise they made grated
on the women&rsquo;s nerves as he talked loudly and
incessantly, and they listened. Maria kept
her face hidden in her hands, but Gemma held
herself erect as ever, and she did not move
when the two girls came in, though her sombre
eyes were full of shame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I say to my friends in Lucca?&rdquo;
raved Orazio. &ldquo;What shall I say to my
mother? Even if I still consented to marry
you she would not permit it; she would refuse
to live in the same house with such a person&mdash;and
she would be right. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mamma mia!</em> She
is always right. She said, &lsquo;The girl is beautiful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
but she has no money, and I tell you to
think twice.&rsquo; I have been trapped here by all
you women. You all knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pointed an accusing finger at Signora
Carosi. She sobbed helplessly, bitterly, as she
tried to answer him, and Olive, who had waited
in the shadow by the door, hoping that he
would move on and enable her to pass into her
own room, came forward and stood beside her
aunt. She had thought she would feel abashed
before this man who had been wronged, but he
had made her angry instead, and now she
would not have left the room if he had asked
her, or have told him the truth if he had
begged for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many girls have been offered me,&rdquo; he
went on excitedly, &ldquo;but I would not hear of
them because you were beautiful, and I
thought you would make a good wife. There
was Annina Giannini; she had five thousand
lire, and more to come, and now she is married
to a doctor in Lucca. I gave her up for you,
and you are dust of the streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemma flinched then as though he had
struck her. The insult was flagrant, and it
was time to make an end. She rose from her
chair slowly, as though she were very tired,
and filled her glass from the decanter on the
table with a hand that trembled so that half
the wine was spilled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Orazio,&rdquo; she said, and her dark eyes sought
his and held them so that he was compelled to
stand still looking at her. &ldquo;Orazio, I hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
you and your ugly fool of a mother will die
slowly of a horrible disease, and be tormented
in hell for ever. May your flesh be covered
with sores while your bones rot and are gnawed
by worms. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cosi sia!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She crossed herself devoutly, and then
drank some of the wine and flung the glass over
her shoulder. It fell to the floor and crashed
to splinters.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s jaw dropped and his mouth fell
open, but he had no words to answer her. She
made a curious movement with her hands as
though she would cleanse them of some impurity,
and then turned and went quickly into
her own room. They all heard the bolts
drawn and the key turned in the lock.</p>

<p>Olive was the first to speak, and her voice
sounded strange and unnatural to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has said her say and left us, Signor
Lucis. Will you not go too? You will not
marry her. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Benissimo!</em> We wish you good-evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very easy, signorina <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mia</i>,&rdquo; he
answered resentfully; &ldquo;but I cannot forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who asked your forgiveness?&rdquo; she retorted.
&ldquo;It is you who should beg our
pardon&mdash;you, who are so ready to believe the
tales that are told in the <i>caf&eacute;s</i> and to come
here to abuse helpless women. You are a
coward, signore. Oh, how I hate men ...
Judges in Israel ... I would have them stoned
first. <em>What&rsquo;s that?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was shouting in the street, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a loud knocking on the house door. The
women looked at each other with frightened
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carmela ran to Gemma&rsquo;s door and shook the
handle, calling to her to come out. There was
no answer, and perhaps they had a dreadful premonition
of the truth even then; Olive left them
huddled together like frightened sheep. The
knocking still continued, and it sounded very
loud when she came out of the flat on to the
stairs. She was beside herself; that is, she
was aware of two Olives, one who spoke in a
strange voice and trembled, and was now going
down into the darkness, stumbling at nearly
every step and moaning incoherent prayers to
God, and one who watched and listened and
was surprised at what was said and done.</p>

<p>When she opened the great house door a
man stood aside to let her come out. She
looked at him and knew him to be one of the
neighbours, and she wondered why he had run
out into the street in his shirt-sleeves. He
was pale, too, and looked ill, and he seemed
to want to speak to her, but she could not
listen.</p>

<p>A crowd had collected about something
that was lying on the pavement near their
house wall; Olive looked up and saw Gemma&rsquo;s
window opened wide, and then she knew what
it was. The people made way for her and let
her come to where the dead thing lay on its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
back with the knees drawn up. Some woman
had already covered the face with a handkerchief,
and dark blood was oozing out from
under it. Olive crouched down beside its
pitiful disarray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will someone help me carry her into the
house?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>No one answered her, and after a while she
spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will someone fetch a doctor quickly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">figlia mia</i>; she is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least&rdquo;&mdash;her voice broke, and she had
to begin again, making a painful effort to
control the words that she might be quite
intelligible&mdash;&ldquo;at least help me to carry her
in from the street. Is there no Christian
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri</i> came running up now, and
they made the people stand back so that a
space of pavement was left clear; the younger
man spoke to Olive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot move the body until the authorities
come, signorina. It must stay where it is,
but we shall guard it and keep the people off,
and you can fetch a sheet from the house to
cover it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when will they
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slightly shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know. We have sent to tell them.
In a few minutes, perhaps, or in two hours,
three hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we must leave her here?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, signorina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get the sheet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He helped her to rise from her knees.
Looking down she saw a stain of blood on her
skirt, and she clung to his arm for a moment,
swaying as though she would fall. There was
a murmur among the people of pity and sympathy.
&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poveretta! Che disgrazia!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coraggio!</em>&rdquo; the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabiniere</i> said gently.</p>

<p>Up again, up all the dark stairs, wondering
if the others knew and were afraid to come
down, wondering if there had been much pain,
wondering if it was not all a dreadful dream
from which she must wake presently. They
knew.</p>

<p>The younger girl met her cousin at the door;
Maria had fainted, and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">la zia</i> was hysterical;
as to Orazio, he was sitting on the sofa crying,
with his mean, mouse-coloured head buried in
the cushions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked out of your bedroom window as I
could not get into her room,&rdquo; whispered
Carmela. &ldquo;Oh, Olive, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to take down a sheet as they
will not let us bring her in. You can come
with me, and we will stay beside her and say
prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Oh, Olive, that is a good idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two came out into the street together
and spread the white linen covering carefully
over the stark body before they knelt, one on
each side. Of the thousands who had filled
the Piazzale at sunset hundreds came now to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
see them mourning the broken thing that lay
between. Olive was aware of many faces, of
the murmuring of a great crowd, and shame
was added to the horror that held her fast.
She folded her hands and tried to keep her
eyes fixed upon them. Then she began to pray
aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater noster, qui es in coelis, sanctificetur
nomen tuum&mdash;</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clear voice was tremulous at first, but it
gathered strength as it went on, and Carmela
said the words too. The men in the crowd
uncovered, and the women crossed themselves.</p>

<p>Rain was falling now, slowly at first and in
heavy drops that splashed upon the stones,
and there was a threatening sound&mdash;a rumbling
of thunder&mdash;away in the south.</p>

<p>Olive knew no more prayers in Latin, but
her cousin began the Miserere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere mei, Deus, secundum magnam
misericordiam tuam, et secundum multitudinem
miserationum tuarum, dele iniquitatem meam.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the many who had come to look their
last upon the Odalisque were men who had
made free with her poor name, had been
unsparing in their utterance of the truth concerning
her and ready to drag her down, and
some of these moved away now shamefacedly,
but more stayed, and one after another took
up the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea: et a
peccato meo munda me.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemma herself had trodden out the fire that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
consumed her, but who could dare say of the
grey cold ashes, &ldquo;These are altogether vile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tibi soli peccavi, et malum coram te feci:
ut justificeris in sermonibus tuis et vincas cum
judicaris.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had sinned, and she had been punished;
she had suffered fear and shame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asperges me hyssopo et mundabor, lavabis
me, et super nivem dealbabor.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had been some taint in her blood,
some flaw in her will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cor mundum crea in me, Deus, et spiritum
rectum innova in visceribus meis.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dark-eyed slender boy, wearing the green
and white and scarlet of his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contrade</i>, pushed
his way to the front presently. It was Romeo,
and he carried a great bunch of magnolia
blossoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, signorina,&rdquo; he said, half crying, &ldquo;the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">alfieri</i> and I wanted to give you these because
you brought us good luck so that we won the
Palio. I little thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped short, hesitating, and afraid to
come nearer. He thought she looked like one
of the stone angels that kneel on the sculptured
tombs in the Campo Santo; her face seemed
rough hewn in the harsh white glare of the
electric light, so deep were the shadows under
her eyes and the lines of pain about the praying
lips. His heart ached with pity for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give them to me,&rdquo; she said, and he was
allowed to come into the space that the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabiniere</i>
kept clear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
He thrust the bunch hurriedly into her
hands, faltering, &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio vi benedica</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Andatevi con Dio</i>,&rdquo; she replied, and then
laid the pale flowers and the shimmering green
crown of leaves down upon the still breast.
&ldquo;Gemma, if ever I hurt you, forgive me now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was raining heavily, and as the sheet
grew damp it clung more closely to the body
of the girl who lay there with arms outstretched
and knees drawn up as though
she were nailed to a cross.</p>

<p>The boy still lingered. &ldquo;You will be
drenched. Go into the house,&rdquo; he urged.
Then, seeing he could not move her, he took
off his velvet embroidered cloak and put it
about her shoulders. A woman in the crowd
came forward with a shawl for Carmela.</p>

<p>So the hours passed.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">BOOK II.&mdash;FLORENCE</h2>



<h3 class="padtop">CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>October can be cold enough sometimes in the
Val d&rsquo;Arno when the snow falls on the Apennines,
and the woods of Vallombrosa are sere,
and Florence, the flower city, lies then at the
mercy of the winds. Mamie Whittaker, who,
in her own phrase, &ldquo;hated to be blown about
anyhow,&rdquo; had not been out all day. She
lolled in an armchair before a crackling fire
of olive wood in the room that she &ldquo;lit with
herself when alone,&rdquo; though scarcely in the
Tennysonian sense. Hers was a vivid personality,
and older women who disliked her called
her flamboyant, and referred to an evident
touch of the tar-brush that would make her
socially impossible in America though it
passed unnoticed in Italy. Her age was
seventeen, and she dressed after Carmen to
please herself, and read Gyp with the same
intention. She was absorbed now in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Amoureux</i>, and had to be told twice that her
cousin had come before she would look up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Marvel? Show her in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose and went forward to greet her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
relative, whom she had not seen for some
years, and the two met at the door and kissed
each other with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edna! My! Well, you have not grown
anyway. What a tiny thing! Come and sit
down right here.&rdquo; She rang for tea while her
visitor slowly and rather shyly divested herself
of her sables and laid them on a side table.
Edna Marvel was the elder of the two by three
years, but she was so small that she seemed a
mere child. Her sallow little face resembled
that of a tired monkey, yet it had an elfin
charm, and her hands were beautiful as carved
toys of ivory made in the East for a king&rsquo;s son
to play with. They might hold a man&rsquo;s heart
perhaps, but Mamie did not notice them, her
own allurements being of more obvious description.</p>

<p>She thought Edna was real homely, and her
spirits rose accordingly. &ldquo;Where are you
staying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the Bristol. Poppa guessed we would
take a villa later on if we felt like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mamie rang again. &ldquo;Bring some more
cakes, and tell Miss Agar to come and pour
out the tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Miss Agar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My companion, a sort of governess person.
She takes me out walks, and sits by when my
music-master comes, and so forth. She is new,
and she won&rsquo;t do, but I may as well make her
useful while she stays.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t she do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she just won&rsquo;t. Momma don&rsquo;t
like her much, and I&rsquo;m not singing her
praises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna looked curiously at the slender girl in
the black dress who came in and took her
place at the table.</p>

<p>She said &ldquo;Good afternoon&rdquo; in her pleasant
little voice.</p>

<p>The governess person seemed rather surprised
that she should address her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Do you
take milk and sugar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring them round for us to help ourselves,&rdquo;
dictated Mamie.</p>

<p>Olive only smiled as she repeated her question,
but Edna was distressed at her cousin&rsquo;s
rudeness, and her sensitive face was quite pink
as she hurriedly declined sugar. She came to
the table to fetch her cup, but Miss Whittaker
waited for hers to be brought to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like this room, Edna? I had
it fixed up for myself, and everything in it is
mine.&rdquo; She looked complacently up at the
hangings of primrose silk that hid the fifteenth
century frescoes on the walls.</p>

<p>Her cousin hesitated. &ldquo;I guess it must
have cost some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The Marchese does not like it. He
is so set on his worm-eaten old tapestries and
carved chairs, and he wanted momma to refurnish
the palace to match, but not she!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Louis Quinze, she said, and Louis Quinze it is,
more or less. I tell the Marchese that if he is
so fond of the musty Middle Ages he ought to
go about in armour himself by rights. But
the old sinner is not really a bit romantic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It occurred to Olive that the right kind of
governess would utter a word in season. &ldquo;It
is not usual for young girls to refer to their
stepfathers as you do,&rdquo; she said drily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you know mine better,&rdquo; Mamie
answered unabashed. &ldquo;Last night he said
your complexion was miraculous. Next
thing he&rsquo;ll try if it comes off. Are you coming
to dinner to-night, Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, auntie asked us. The&mdash;the Prince
will be here, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mamie looked down her nose. &ldquo;Oh,
yes,&rdquo; she said carelessly. &ldquo;Your beau
will come. People generally do when we
ask them. The food is all right, and we
have real good music afterwards sometimes.
You know Avenel stays in Florence whiles
because his brother has a Villa at Settignano.
Well, momma guessed she would get him to
play here for nothing once. Of course she
was willing to pay any money for him really,
but she just thought she would try it on. She
asked him to dinner with a lot of other people,
and made him take her in, though there were
two Neapolitan dukes among the guests. The
food was first-rate; she had told the cook to
do his best, and she really thought the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr&eacute;e</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
would have made Vitellius sit up. It was
perfect. Well, afterwards she asked Avenel
to play, and he just smiled and said he could
not. Why, she said, he gave a recital the day
before for nothing, for a charity, and played
the people&rsquo;s souls out of their bodies, made
them act crazy, as he always does. Couldn&rsquo;t
he play for friendship? No, he said, he
couldn&rsquo;t just then because one must be filled
with sorrow oneself before one can make others
feel, and he inferred that he had no room even
for regret. &lsquo;I play Chopin on a biscuit,&rsquo; he
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be rather a pig,&rdquo; was Edna&rsquo;s
comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. Momma said he really
had not eaten much; in fact she had noticed
that he left a bit of that lovely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr&eacute;e</i>. Perhaps
he is afraid of getting fat. Momma was
real mad with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive&rsquo;s cheeks were flushed and her hands
trembled as she arranged the cups on the tray.
She was thankful for the shelter afforded by
the great silver tea-pot. Mamie&rsquo;s back was
turned to her, but Edna seemed desirous of
including her in the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard Avenel, Miss Agar?&rdquo; she
asked presently in her gentle, drawling way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Is he very famous? I have never
heard of him as a pianist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, his professional name is Meryon, of
course. He is billed as that and known all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
world over, though he only began to play in
public three years ago when his wife left him.
She was always a horrid woman, and she made
him marry her when he was quite a boy, they
say. They say he plays to forget things as
other men take to drink. He has been twice
to New York, and I know a girl who says he
gave her a lock of his hair, but I don&rsquo;t believe
her. It is dark brown, almost black, but I
guess she cut it off a switch. He&rsquo;s not that
kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not stay if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo;
Mamie said unceremoniously. &ldquo;Be ready to
come down after dinner. I might want you
to play my accompaniments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you say she won&rsquo;t
do,&rdquo; cried Edna when she was gone out
of the room. &ldquo;I call her perfectly sweet.
Rather sad-looking, but just lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mamie sniffed. &ldquo;Glad you admire her,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>The governess was expected to appear at
luncheon, but dinner was served to her in
her own room, where she must sit in solitary
state, dressed in her best and waiting for a
summons, until eleven o&rsquo;clock, when she might
assume that she would not be wanted and go
to bed. This evening Olive lingered rather
anxiously over her dressing, trying to make
the best of herself, since it seemed that she
was really to come down to-night into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
yellow drawing-room where she spent so many
weary hours of a morning listening to Mamie
scraping her Strad while the German who
was supposed to teach her possessed his soul
in patience. She put on her black silk dress.
It was a guinea robe bought at a sale in
Oxford Street the year before, a reach-me-down
garment for women to sneer at and
men to describe vaguely as something dark,
and she hated the poor thing.</p>

<p>Most women believe that the men who like
them in cotton frocks would adore them in
cloth of gold, and are convinced that the
secret of Cleopatra&rsquo;s charm lay in her extensive
wardrobe.</p>

<p>Avenel. It had shocked Olive to hear his
name uttered by alien lips, as it hurt her to suppose
that he came often to the Palazzo Lorenzoni.
She would not suppose it, and, indeed,
nothing that Mamie had said could lead her to
think that he was a friend of the family. They
had clutched at him greedily, and he had repaid
with an impertinence. That was all.</p>

<p>The third footman, whose duty it was to
attend upon her, brought two covered dishes
on a tray at eight o&rsquo;clock, and soon after nine
he came again to fetch her.</p>

<p>There was a superabundance of gorgeous
lackeys in the corridors that had been dusty
and deserted five years before, and a gigantic
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suisse</i> stood always on guard now outside
the palace gates. The Marchesa would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
liked to have had outriders in her scarlet
livery when she went out driving in the
streets of Florence, but her husband warned
her that some mad anarchist might take her
for the Queen, and so she contented herself
with a red racing motor. The millions old
Whittaker had made availed to keep his
widow and the man who had given her a title
in almost regal state. They entertained
largely, and the Via Tornabuoni was often
blocked with the carriages and motors that
brought their guests. Olive, sitting alone in
her chilly bedroom, mending her stockings
or trying to read, heard voices and laughter
as the doors opened&mdash;harsh Florentine and
high English voices, and the shrill sounds of
American mirth&mdash;night after night. But the
Lorenzoni dined <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en famille</i> sometimes, as even
marquises and millionaires may do, and
there were but two shirt-fronts and comparatively
few diamonds in the great golden
shining room when she entered it.</p>

<p>The Marchesa, handsome, hard-featured,
gorgeous in grey and silver, did not choose to
notice her daughter&rsquo;s governess; she was
deep in talk with her brother-in-law; but
men could not help looking at Olive. Mr
Marvel stood up and bowed as she passed,
and the silent, saturnine Marchese stared.
His black eyes were intent upon her as she
came to the piano where Mamie was restlessly
turning over the music, and no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
watching him could fail to see that he was
making comparisons that were probably to
the disadvantage of his step-daughter.</p>

<p>Fast men are not necessarily fond of the
patchouli atmosphere in their own homes, and
somehow Mamie seemed to reek of that scent,
though in fact she never used it. She was
clever and fairly well educated, and she had
always been sheltered and cared for, but she
was born to the scarlet, and everything she
said and did, her way of walking, the use she
made already of her black eyes, proclaimed
it. To-night, though she wore the red she
loved&mdash;a wonderful, flaring frock of chiffon
frills and flounces&mdash;she looked ill, and her dark
face was sullen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beastly wind has given me a stiff
neck,&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;Here, I want to
have this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She chose a coon&rsquo;s lullaby out of the pile
of songs, and Olive sat down obediently and
began the accompaniment. It was a pretty
little ditty of the usual moony order, and
Mamie sang it well enough. Mr Marvel
looked up when it was over to say, &ldquo;Thank
you, my dear. Very nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a silly thing,&rdquo; Mamie answered ungraciously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing you a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">canzonetta</i> now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned over the music, scattering
marches and sonatas, and throwing some of
them on the floor in her impatience. Olive,
wondering at her temper, presently divined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the cause of it. The folding doors that led
into the library were half closed. No lamps,
but a flicker of firelight and the hush of
lowered voices, Edna&rsquo;s pleasant little pipe
and a man&rsquo;s brief, murmured answers, and
there were short spaces of silence too. The
American girl and her prince were there.</p>

<p>The Marchese had raised his eyebrows
at the first words of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">canzonetta</i>, and at
the end of the second verse he was smiling
broadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little devil!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>No one heard him. His wife was showing
her brother-in-law some of her most treasured
bits of china. She was quite calm, as though
her knowledge of Italian was fair the Neapolitan
dialect was beyond her. Mr Marvel, of
course, knew not a syllable of any language
but his own, and the slang of Southern gutters
was as Greek to Olive. Their placidity
amused the Marchese, and so did the thought
of the little scene that he knew was being
enacted in the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we join the others now, Edna,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carissima</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nearly laughed aloud as he saw the
silk curtains drawn. The Prince stood aside
to allow Edna to pass in first, and Olive,
glancing up momentarily from the unfamiliar
notes, saw the green gleam of an emerald on
the strong brown hand as the brocaded folds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
were lifted up. Her own hands swerved,
blundered, and she perpetrated a hopeless
discord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said confusedly.</p>

<p>Mamie shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Never
mind,&rdquo; she answered lightly. &ldquo;The last
verse don&rsquo;t matter anyway. Come to here,
Edna. Momma wants to hear your fiddle-playing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, play us something, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl came forward shyly.</p>

<p>As the Prince and the Marchese stood
together by the fireplace at the other end of
the long room Mamie joined them. &ldquo;You
sang that devil&rsquo;s nocturne inimitably,&rdquo; observed
her stepfather, drily. &ldquo;I am quite
sorry to have to ask you not to do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not again? Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She perched herself on the arm of one of the
great gilt chairs. The Prince raised his eyes
from the thoughtful contemplation of her
ankles to stare at her impudent red parted
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not! Need I explain, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cara</i>? It
was delicious; I enjoyed it, but, alas!&rdquo; He
heaved an exaggerated sigh and then laughed,
and the young man and the girl shared in his
merriment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to make so many mistakes,&rdquo;
Olive said apologetically as she laboured
away at her part of an easy piece arranged
for violin and piano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, it is nothing. I have made ever so
many myself, and I ought to have turned the
page for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentle voice was rather tremulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was charming,&rdquo; pronounced the
Marchesa. &ldquo;Now that sonata, Edna. I am
so fond of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, auntie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince had gone into the billiard-room
with his host, and Mamie was with them.
They were knocking the balls about and
laughing ... laughing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>In the Cascine gardens the lush green grass of
the glades was strewn with leaves; soon the
branches would be bare, or veiled only in
winter mists, and the Arno, swollen with rain,
ran yellow as Tiber. It was not a day for
music, but the sun shone, and many idle
Florentines drove, or rode, or walked by the
Lung&rsquo;Arno to the Rajah&rsquo;s monument, passing
and repassing the bench where Olive sat
with Madame de Sarivi&egrave;re&rsquo;s stout and elderly
German Fr&auml;ulein. Mamie was not far away;
flamboyant as ever in her frock of crimson
serge, her black curls tied with ribbon and
streaming in the wind, she was the loud centre
of a group of girls who played some running
game to an accompaniment of shrill cries and
little screams of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like young girls?&rdquo; Olive asked
the question impulsively, after a long silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am fond of my pupils; they are good
little things, rather foolish, but amiable.
But I understand your feeling, my poor Miss
Agar. Your charge is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive hesitated. &ldquo;It is a difficult age;
and she has the body of twenty and the sense
of ten. I am putting it very badly, but&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
I was hateful years ago too. I think one
always is, perhaps. I remember at school
there were self-righteous little girls; they
were narrow and intolerant, easily shocked,
and rather bad-tempered. The others were
absurdly vain, sentimental, sly. All that
comes away afterwards if one is going to be
nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are female but not yet womanly. The
newly-awakened instincts clamour at first for
a hearing; later they learn to wait in silence,
to efface themselves, to die, even,&rdquo; answered
the Fr&auml;ulein, gravely.</p>

<p>A victoria passed, then some youths on
bicycles, shouting to each other and ringing
their bells. They were riding all together, but
they scattered to let Prince Tor di Rocca go by.
He was driving tandem, and his horses were
very fresh. Edna was with him, her small wan
face rather set in its halo of ashen blonde hair
and pale against the rich brown of her sables.</p>

<p>When they came by the second time Mamie
called to her cousin. The Prince drew rein,
and the groom sprang down and ran to the
leader&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, Edna, how cold you look! It&rsquo;s three
days since I saw you, but I guess Don Filippo
has been doing the honours. Have you seen
all the old galleries and things? Momma said
she noticed you and uncle in a box at the
Pergola last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood by the wheel, and as she looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
up, not at Edna but at the Prince, he glanced
smilingly down at her and then away
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going back to the hotel now,&rdquo;
Edna said. &ldquo;Will you come and have
tea, Mamie? Is that Miss Agar over there?
Ask her if you may, and if she will come
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to ask her,&rdquo; the girl answered,
but she went back nevertheless and spoke to
Olive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can the groom take the cart home,
Filippo? We will walk back with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bellina is in spirits, but she will not
run away from Giovanni,&rdquo; he said, trying
not to seem surprised that she should curtail
their drive.</p>

<p>They crossed the wide gravelled space
outside the gardens and walked towards the
town by the Lung&rsquo;Arno. Already the cypresses
of San Miniato showed black against
the sky, and the reflected flame of sunset was
dying out in the windows of the old houses at
the river&rsquo;s edge. All the people were going
one way now, and leaving the tree-shadowed
dusk for the brightly-lit streets, Via Tornabuoni,
all palaces and antiquity shops, and
Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, where the band
would play presently.</p>

<p>The two American girls walked together
with Don Filippo and Olive followed them.
Edna held herself very erect, but Mamie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
seemed almost to lean backwards. She
swayed her hips as she went and swung her
short skirts, and there was affectation and a
feverish self-consciousness in her every movement.
Olive could not help smiling to herself,
but she remembered that at school she had
been afflicted with the idea that a pout&mdash;the
delicious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moue</i> of fiction&mdash;became her,
and so she was inclined to leniency. Only
seventeen.</p>

<p>The Prince wore riding gloves, and so the
green gleam of his emerald was hidden from
her. If only she could be sure that she had
seen him before. What then? Nothing&mdash;if
she could think that he would always be kind
to gentle little Edna.</p>

<p>Just before they reached the hotel Miss
Marvel joined her, leaving her cousin to go on
with Don Filippo, and began to talk to
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The river is just perfect at this hour. Our
sitting-room has a balcony and I sat there last
night watching the moon rise over San
Miniato. I guess it looked just that way
when Dante wrote his sonnets. Beatrice
must have been real mad with him sometimes,
don&rsquo;t you think so? She must have been
longing to say, &lsquo;Come on, and don&rsquo;t keep
talking.&rsquo; But she was a nice high-minded
girl, and so she never did. She simply
died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she died for him she must have been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
fool,&rdquo; Olive said shortly. Her eyes were fixed
on the Prince&rsquo;s broad back. He was laughing
at some sally of Mamie&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Edna was shocked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you just worship
Dante?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; answered the elder girl. &ldquo;He
was a dear, but even he was not worth that.
At least, I don&rsquo;t know. He was a dear;
but I was thinking of a girl I knew ...
perhaps I may tell you about her some
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; Edna said perfunctorily. She
was trying to hear what her cousin was saying
to Filippo, and wishing she could amuse him
as well. They passed through the wide hall
of the hotel and went up in the lift. The
Marvels&rsquo; private sitting-room was on the
second floor. They were much too rich to
condescend to the palms and bamboo tables
and wicker chairs of the common herd, and
tea was served to Edna and her guests in a
green and white boudoir that was, as the
Marchesa might have said, more or less Louis
Seize.</p>

<p>Mr Marvel came in presently, refusing tea,
but asking leave to smoke, and the Prince,
gracefully deferential to his future father-in-law,
listened to the little he had to say,
answering carefully in his perfect English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. There is a great deal of poverty
here. On my Tuscan estates too. Alas!
yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Mamie sat near him, and in the flickering
red light of the fire she looked almost
pretty. Filippo&rsquo;s eyes strayed towards her
now and then. Edna came presently to
where Olive rested apart on the wide
cushioned window-seat. &ldquo;Will you have
some more tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I think we must be going
soon. The Marchesa will not like it if we stay
out too long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna hesitated. &ldquo;I wanted to ask you a
silly question. Had you ever seen the Prince
before last week?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was the slightest perceptible pause
before Olive answered, &ldquo;No, never. Why
do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you looked as if you had somehow
that night at the Lorenzoni palace.
When we came in you were at the piano, and
I thought you looked queer&mdash;as if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Olive said again, but she wondered
afterwards if she had done right.</p>

<p>On their way home Mamie drew her attention
to a poster, and she saw the name of
Meryon in great orange letters on a white
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be here before Christmas. I&rsquo;ll
let you come with me to hear him play if you
are good,&rdquo; she said, and she took the elder
girl&rsquo;s hand in hers and pinched it. &ldquo;I could
race you home down this side street, but I
suppose I must not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
She was gay and good-humoured now, and
altogether at her best, and Olive tried hard
to like her, but she could not help seeing that
the triumph that overflowed in easy, shallow
kindness was an unworthy one.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>Olive sat alone at the end of one of the tiers
of the stone amphitheatre built into the hill
that rises, ilex clad, to the heights of San
Giorgio. Some other women were there,
mothers with young children, nurses and
governesses dowdily dressed as she was in
dark-coloured stuffs, but she knew none of
them.</p>

<p>Mamie seldom cared to come to the old Boboli
gardens. Its green mildewed terraces and
crumbling deities of fountain and ilex grove
had no charm for her, and as a rule she and her
friends preferred the crowded Lung&rsquo;Arno and
Cascine on the days when there was music,
but this Thursday she had suggested that they
should come across the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daisy Vereker has promised to meet me,
and as she is only here a week on her way to
school in Paris I should hate to disappoint
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls were lingering now about
the grass arena, talking volubly, whispering,
giggling. Miss Vereker&rsquo;s maid, a yellow-haired
Swiss, sat not far off with her knitting,
and every now and then she called harshly to
her charge to know the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Olive sat very still, her hands clasped,
her eyes fixed on the far horizon. She loved
the old-world silence that was only broken
by the dripping of water in the pools. No
birds sang here, no leaves fell at the waning
of the year. The seasons had little power over
stained marble and moss, cypress, and ilex
and olive, and as spring brought no riot of
green and rose and gold in flower, so autumn
took nothing away. Surely there were ghosts
in the shadowed avenues, flitting in and out
among the trees, joining hands to dance &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la
ronde</i>&rdquo; about the pool of Neptune. Gay
abb&eacute;s, cavaliers, beautiful ladies of the late
Renaissance, red-heeled, painted, powdered;
frail, degenerate children of the hard-headed
old Florentine citizens pictured in the frescoes
of Giotto and Masaccio. No greater shades
could come to Boboli.</p>

<p>Florence was half hidden by the great
yellow bulk of the Pitti palace, but Olive
could see the slender, exquisite white and rose
tower of Giotto, and the mellowed red of the
cathedral&rsquo;s dome against the faint purple of
the hills beyond Fiesole, and she looked at
them in preference to the contorted river gods
and exuberant nymphs of the fountain in the
royal courtyard close by.</p>

<p>After a while she opened her book and began
to read. Presently she shivered; her jacket
was thin, and the air grew chilly as the afternoon
waned, but her reading absorbed her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and she was surprised, when at last she raised
her eyes, to see that the Pitti palace was
already dark against the sky. Nurses and
children were making their way out, and soon
those who lingered would hear stentorian
shouts from the gardeners, &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ora si chiude!</em>&rdquo;
and they too would leave by one or other of
the gates.</p>

<p>Olive climbed down into the arena. Mamie
was nowhere in sight, and Daisy Vereker and
her maid were gone too. Olive, thinking
that perhaps they might have gone up to the
fountain of Neptune, began to climb the hill.
She asked an old man who was coming down
from there if he had seen two young ladies,
one dressed in red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, signorina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried back to the arena and spoke to
a woman there. &ldquo;Have you seen a young
lady in red with black curls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered readily: &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sicuro!</em> She
went towards the Porta Romana half an hour
ago. I think the other signorina was leaving
and she wished to accompany her a part of
the way. There was an older person with
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive&rsquo;s relief was only momentary; it
sounded well, but one might walk to the
Porta Romana and back twice in the time.
Soon the gates would be closed, and if she
had not found Mamie then, and the gardeners
made her leave with the others, what should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
she do? She suspected a trick. The girl
had a mischievous and impish humour that
delighted in the infliction of small hurts, and
she might have gone home, happy in the
thought that her governess would get a
&ldquo;wigging,&rdquo; or she might be hiding about
somewhere to give her a fright.</p>

<p>Olive went up the steep path towards the
Belvedere, hoping to find her there. That
part of the garden was not much frequented,
and the white bodies and uplifted arms of the
marble gods gleamed ghostly and forlorn
in the dusk of the ilex woods that lay between
the amphitheatre and the gate.</p>

<p>She went on until she saw a glimmer of red
through the close-woven branches. Mamie
was there in the dark wood, and she was not
alone. A man was with her, and he was
holding her easily, as if he knew she would not
go yet, and laughing as she stood on tiptoe
to reach the fine cruel lips that touched
hers presently, when he chose that they
should.</p>

<p>Olive turned and ran up the path to the
top of the hill, and there she stood for a
while, trying to get her breath, trying to be
calm, and sane and tolerant, to see no harm
where perhaps there was none after all. And
yet the treachery and the deceit were so
flagrant that surely no condonation was
possible. She felt sick of men and women,
and of life itself, since the greatest thing in it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
seemed to be this hateful, miscalled love that
preceded sorrow and shame and death. Was
love always loathsome to look upon? Not
in pictures or on the stage, where it was represented
as a kind of minuet in which the
man makes graceful advances to a woman
who smiles as she draws away, but in real
life&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not real love,&rdquo; she said to herself.
&ldquo;Oh, God, help me to go on believing in
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raising her eyes she saw the evening star
sparkling in a wide, soft, clear space of sky. It
seemed infinitely pure and remote, and yet
somehow good and kind, as it had to Dante
when he climbed up out of hell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Quindi uscimmo a riveder le stelle.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ora si chiude!</em>&rdquo; bawled a gardener from
the Belvedere.</p>

<p>Mamie came hurrying up the path towards
the hill. &ldquo;Oh, are you there?&rdquo; she said in
some confusion. &ldquo;I went some of the way
to the other gate with Daisy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to be afraid you were
lost, so I came along hoping to meet you,&rdquo;
answered Olive.</p>

<p>She said nothing to the girl of what she
had seen. It would have been useless;
nothing could alter or abash her inherent
unmorality. But after dinner she wrote a
note to Edna and went out herself to
post it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The answer came at noon on the following
day. Miss Marvel would be at home and
alone between three and four and would be
pleased to see Miss Agar then; meanwhile
she remained very sincerely her friend.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Why do you tell me this now?&rdquo; asked Edna.
&ldquo;The other day when I asked you if you had
known him before you said you had not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something that has happened since then
determined me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna&rsquo;s room was full of flowers, roses,
narcissi and violets, and the air was heavy
with their scent. Filippo had never failed in
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits soins</i>. It was so easy to give an
order at the florist&rsquo;s, and the bill would come
in presently, after the wedding, and be paid in
American dollars. There were boxes of sweets
too; and a volume of Romola, bound in white
and gold, lay on the table. Edna had been
looking at the inscription on the fly-leaf when
Olive came in. &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carissima</i>&rdquo; he had written,
and she had believed him, but that was half an
hour ago. Now her small body was shaken
with sobs, her face was stained with tears
because that faith she had had was dying.</p>

<p>The chill at her heart made her feel altogether
cold, and she edged her chair nearer to
the fire, and put her feet up on the fender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could feel it was not true, but
somehow though I have been so fond of him I
have not trusted him. Well, your cousin was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
beautiful, and perhaps he had known her a
long time before he knew me. He wanted to
say good-bye kindly. He was entangled&mdash;such
things happen, I know. He could not
help what happened afterwards. That was
not his fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive could not meet her pleading eyes.
&ldquo;I thought something like that last week,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;And that is why I kept silence;
but now I know he would make you unhappy
always. Oh, forgive me for hurting you so.&rdquo;
She came and knelt down beside the little
girl, and put her arms about her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
cry, my dear. Don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Olive, I was so fond of him! Now tell
me what has happened since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your hands in mine. There, I will rub
the poor tiny things and warm them. They are
so pretty. Yesterday, in the Boboli gardens,
I missed your cousin, and when I went to look
for her I saw her with the Prince. He held her
and was kissing her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Edna sprang to her feet. &ldquo;That
settles it. Mamie is common and real homely,
and if he can run after her I have done
with him. I could have forgiven the other,
especially as she is dead, but Mamie! Gracious!
Here he is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came into the room leisurely, smiling,
very sure of his welcome. Olive met the hot
insolence of his stare steadily, and Edna
turned her back on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
&ldquo;Olive,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you speak to him.
Tell him&mdash;ask him&mdash;&rdquo; Her gentle voice broke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you twice in Siena last summer.
Do you remember <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Rigoletto</i> at the Lizza
theatre? You were in the stage box. You
wore evening dress, and I saw that emerald
ring you have now on your finger. The next
day you met my Cousin Gemma in my room
in the Vicolo dei Moribondi. Do you remember
the steep dark stairs and the white
walls of the bare place where you saw her
last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no answer, and there was still a
smile on his lips, but his eyes were hard.
Edna was looking at him now, but he seemed
to have forgotten her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you loved her,&rdquo; Olive said
slowly. &ldquo;Do you remember the faint pink
curve of her mouth, the little cleft in her chin,
and her hair that was so soft and fine? There
were always little stray curls on the white
nape of her neck. I came to my room that
morning to fetch a book. When I had climbed
the stairs I found that I had not the key with
me, but the door was unlocked and I saw her
there with a man, and I saw the green gleam
of an emerald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Men have such a power of silence. No
woman but would have made some answer
now, denying with a show of surprise, making
excuses, using words in one way or another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
&ldquo;They were talking about you in the town,
though I think they did not know who you
were&mdash;at least I never heard your name&mdash;and
that night Gemma&rsquo;s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fidanzato</i> told her he would
not marry her. You know best what that
meant to her. She rushed into her own room
and threw herself out of the window. Ah,
you should have seen the dark blood oozing
through the fine soft curls! She lay dead
in the street for hours before they took her
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santissimo Dio!</em> Is this true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gemma&mdash;I never knew it&mdash;&rdquo; His face
was greatly altered now, and he had to
moisten his lips before he could speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could have forgiven that,&rdquo; Edna said
tremulously after a while. &ldquo;But not yesterday.
Your kisses are too cheap, Filippo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;So Gemma&rsquo;s
cousin saw that too. It was nothing, meant
nothing. Edna, if you can pardon the other,
surely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was nothing; and it proved that Mamie
is nothing, and that you are nothing&mdash;to me.
That is the end of the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He winced now at the contempt underlying
her quiet words, and when she took off
her ring and laid it on the table between
them he picked it up and flung it into the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not take things back,&rdquo; he said
savagely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
When he had left the room Edna began to
cry again. &ldquo;I believe he is suffering now,
but not for me. Would he care if I killed
myself? I guess not. I am not pretty, only
my hands, and hands don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poppa shall take me away right now. I
have had enough of Europe, and so I shall tell
him when he comes in. Must you go now?
Well, good-bye, my dear, and thank you.
You are white all through, and I am glad you
have acted as you have, though it hurts now.
If ever I marry it shall be an American ...
but I was real fond of Filippo.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>


<p>Cardinal Jacopo of Portugal was buried in
a side chapel of the church of San Miniato
al Monte, and his counterfeit presentment,
wrought in stone, lies on the tomb Rossellino
made for him. Rossellino, who loved to carve
garlands of acanthus and small sweet <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">amorini</i>,
has conferred immortality on some of the men
whose tombs he adorned in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">basso-rili&egrave;vo</i>, and
they are remembered because of him; but
the cardinal has another claim. He is
beautiful in himself as he rests there, his
young face set in the peace that passes all
understanding, his thin hands folded on his
breast.</p>

<p>Mourners were kneeling in the central aisles
of the church, and women carrying wreaths
passed through it on their way to the Campo
Santo beyond, for this was the day of All
Souls, and there were fresh flowers on the
new graves, and little black lamps were lit on
those that were grass grown and decked only
with the bead blossoms that are kept in glass
cases and need not be changed once a year.
The afternoon was passing, but still Olive
lingered by the cardinal&rsquo;s monument. Looking
at him understandingly she saw that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
there had been lines of pain about the firm
mouth. He had suffered in his short life, he
had suffered until death came to comfort him
and give him quiet sleep. The mother-sense
in her yearned over him, lying there straight
and still, with closed eyes that had never seen
love; and, womanlike, she pitied the accomplished
loneliness that yet seemed to her the
most beautiful thing in the world. The old
familiar words were in her mind as she looked
down upon this saint uncanonised: &ldquo;Cleanse
the thoughts of my heart by the inspiration of
thy Holy Spirit!&rdquo; and she remembered
Astorre, for whose sake she had come to this
church to pray. Once when she had been
describing a haggard St Francis in the Sienese
gallery to him, he had said: &ldquo;Ah, women
always pity him and admire his picturesque
asceticism, but if married men look worried
they do not notice it. Their troubles are no
compliment to your sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Astorre had not been devout in any
sense, but he had written his friend a long
letter on the day after Gemma&rsquo;s suicide, and
he had asked for her prayers then. &ldquo;Fausto
told me how you knelt there in the street
beside the dead Odalisque and said the Pater-noster
and the Miserere. Perhaps you will
do as much for me one day. Your prayers
should help the soul that is freed now from
the burden of the flesh. I cannot complain
of flesh myself, but my bones weigh and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
shall be glad to be rid of them. Come and
see me soon, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carissima</i> ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning his mother sent for the
girl, but when she came into the darkened
room where he lay he had already passed away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He asked for you, but he would not see
a priest. You know they refused to bury his
father because he fought for united Italy.
Ah! Rome never forgets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the funeral Signora Aurelia had sold
her furniture and gone away, and she was
living now with a widowed sister in Rome.
The Menotti had left Siena too and had gone
to Milan, and Olive, not caring to stay on alone
in the place where everyone knew what had
happened, had come to the Lorenzoni in
Florence. She had had a letter from Carmela
that morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We like Milan as the streets are so gay,
and the shops are beautiful. We should have
got much better mourning here at Bocconi&rsquo;s
if we could have waited, but of course that
was impossible. Our apartment is convenient,
but small and rather dark. Maria hopes you
are fatter. She is going to send you some
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">panforte</i> and a box of sugared fruits at Christmas.
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Zia</i> has begun to crochet another
counterpane; that will be the eighth, and we
have only three beds. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pazienza!</em> It amuses
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Olive was not happy at the Palazzo
Lorenzoni, she could not wish that she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
stayed with her cousins. She felt that their
little life would have stifled her. Thinking of
them, she saw them, happier than before,
since poor Gemma had not been easy to live
with, and quite satisfied to do the same things
every day, waddling out of a morning to
early mass and the marketing, eating and
sleeping during the noon hours, and in the
evenings going to hear the music <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in piazza</i>.</p>

<p>Olive was not happy. She was one of those
women whose health depends upon their
spirits, and of late she had felt her loneliness
to be almost unbearable. Her youth had
cried for all, or nothing. She would have
her love winged and crowned; he should come
to her before all the world. Never would she
set her foot in secret gardens, or let joy come
to her by hidden ways, but now she faced the
future and saw that it was grey, and she was
afraid.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she was destined to
live always in the Social Limbo, suspended
between heaven and earth, an alien in the
drawing-room and not received in the kitchen.
One might as well be <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;class&eacute;e</i> at once, she
thought, and yet she knew that that must be
hell.</p>

<p>If Avenel came to Florence and sought
her out would she be weak as Gemma had
been, light as Mamie was? Olive knelt for
a while on the stones, and her lips moved,
though her prayer was inarticulate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Sunset was burning across the Val d&rsquo;Arno,
and the river flowed as a stream of pure gold
under the dark of the historic bridges.
Already lights sparkled in the windows of the
old houses over the Ponte Vecchio, and the
bells of all the churches were ringing the Ave
Maria as she passed through the whining crowd
of beggars at the gate of the Campo Santo
and went slowly down the hill. The blessed
hour of peace and silence was over now, and
she must trudge back through the clamorous
streets to be with Mamie, to meet the
Marchese&rsquo;s horribly observant eyes, and to be
everlastingly quiet and complacent and useful.
She was paid for that.</p>

<p>She was going up to her room when the
lodge porter ran up the stairs after her with a
letter. &ldquo;For you, signorina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was from Edna.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Olive</span>&rdquo;&mdash;she had written,&mdash;&ldquo;I
could not wait for trains so papa has hired a
car, and we shall motor straight to Genoa
and catch the boat there. I want to go home
to America pretty badly.&mdash;Your loving friend,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Edna</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I am still right down glad you told
me.&mdash;E. M.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>One of the servants came to Olive&rsquo;s room
presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
&ldquo;La Signora Marchesa wishes to see you at
once in her boudoir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marchesa had come straight from the
motor to her own room, her head was still
swathed in a white veil, and she had not even
taken off her heavy sable coat. She had
switched on the light on her entrance, and now
she was searching in the drawers of her bureau
for her cheque-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, gold perhaps,&rdquo; she said after a
while, impatiently, as she snapped open the
chain purse that hung from her wrist. &ldquo;Is
that you, Miss Agar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive, seeing her counting out her money,
like the queen in the nursery rhyme, had
stopped short near the door. She paled a
little as she understood this must be the
sequel to what she had done, but she held her
head high, and there was a light of defiance
in the blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to speak to you very seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marchesa, a large woman, was slow
and deliberate in all her movements. She
took her place on a brocaded settee with the
air of a statue of Juno choosing a pedestal,
and began to draw off her gloves. &ldquo;I greatly
regret that this should be necessary.&rdquo; She
seemed prepared to clean Augean stables,
and there was something judicial in her aspect
too, but she did not look at Olive. &ldquo;You
know that I took you into my house on the
recommendation of the music-teacher, Signora
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Giannini. It was foolish, I see that now.
It has come to my knowledge that you had no
right to enter here, no right to be with my
daughter.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;You must understand
perfectly what I mean,&rdquo; she said impressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not understand,&rdquo; the girl said.
&ldquo;Will you explain, Marchesa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you deny that you were involved in
a most discreditable affair in Siena before you
came here? That your intrigue&mdash;I hate to
have to enter into the unsavoury details, Miss
Agar, but you have forced me to it&mdash;that
your intrigue with your cousin&rsquo;s <i>fianc&eacute;</i> drove
her to suicide, and that you were obliged to
leave the place in consequence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but your cousin killed herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her lover was in the house at the time,
and you were there too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were at the theatre the night before
and everyone noticed that he paid you great
attention?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He? Oh,&rdquo; cried Olive, &ldquo;how horrible,
and how clever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hard grey eyes met hers for a moment.</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s pale face was flushed now with
shame and anger. &ldquo;So clever! Will you
congratulate the Prince for me, Marchesa?&rdquo;
she said very distinctly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
&ldquo;You are impertinent. Of course, I cannot
keep you. My daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marchesa saw her mistake as she made
it and would have passed on, but Olive was
too quick for her. She smiled. &ldquo;Your
daughter! I do not think I can have harmed
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can take your money; I have left
it there for you on the bureau. Please pack
your boxes and be off as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to leave to-night? It is dark
already, and I have no friends in Florence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marchesa shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Olive went slowly out into the hall, and stood
there hesitating at the head of the stairs. She
scarcely knew what to do or where to turn,
but she was determined not to stay longer
than she could help under this roof. She
went down to the porter&rsquo;s lodge in the paved
middle court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gigia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman came hobbling out to greet
her with a toothless smile. &ldquo;Ah, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bella
signorina</i>, there are no more letters for you
to-night. Have you come to talk to me for a
little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going away,&rdquo; the girl answered
hurriedly. &ldquo;Will your husband come in to
fetch my luggage soon? At eight o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gigia laid a skinny hand on Olive&rsquo;s arm,
and her sharp old eyes blinked anxiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
as she said, &ldquo;Where are you going, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nina
mia</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to the Prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrona</i> is hard&mdash;and you are
pretty. I thought it might be that, perhaps.
Don Filippo is like his old wolf of a
father, and young lambs should beware of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me of some quiet, decent
rooms where I can go to night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sicuro!</em> My husband&rsquo;s brother keeps
the Aquila Verde, and you can go there.
Giovanni will give you his best room if he
hears that you come from us, and he will not
charge too much. I am sorry you are going,
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cara</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive squeezed her hand. &ldquo;Thank you,
Gigia. You are the only one I am sorry to
say good-bye to. I shall not forget you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marchese was coming down the stairs
as Olive went up again. He smiled at her
as he stood aside to let her pass. &ldquo;You are
late, are you not? I shall not tell tales but
I hope for your sake that my wife won&rsquo;t see
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t see me again. I am going,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>

<p>He would have detained her. &ldquo;One
moment,&rdquo; he said eagerly, but she was not
listening. &ldquo;I shall miss you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
After all she heard him. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she
said gravely.</p>

<p>A door was closed on the landing below, and
the master of the house glanced at it apprehensively.
He was not sure&mdash;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>


<p>The Aquila Verde was the oldest of the tall
houses in the narrow Vicolo dei Donati; the
lower windows were barred with iron worn by
the rains of four hundred years, and there
were carved marble pillars on either side of
the door. The fa&ccedil;ade had been frescoed once,
and some flakes of colour, red, green and
yellow, still adhered to the wall close under the
deep protecting eaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a palace of the Donati once,&rdquo; the
host explained to Olive as he set a plate of
steaming macaroni swamped in tomato sauce
before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it might have been a convent,
because of the long paved corridors and this
great room that is like a refectory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the Donati lived here. Dante&rsquo;s wife,
Gemma, perhaps. Who knows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ser Giovanni took up a glass and polished
it vigorously with the napkin he carried always
over his arm before he filled it with red
Chianti. He had never had a foreigner in his
house before, but he had heard many tales
about them from the waiters in the great
Anglo-American hotels on the Lung&rsquo;Arno,
and he knew that they craved for warmth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and an unlimited supply of hot water and tea.
Naturally he was afraid of them, and he was
also shy of stray women, but Olive was pretty,
and he was a man, and moreover a Florentine,
and his brother had come with her and had
been earnest in his recommendations, so he
was anxious to please her. &ldquo;There is no
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">dolce</i> to-night,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;But
perhaps you will take an orange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Olive went up to her room presently
she found a great copper jar of hot water
set beside the tiny washstand. The barred
window was high in the thickness of the stone
wall and the uncarpeted floor was of brick.
The place was bare and cold as a cell, but the
bed, narrow and white as that of Mary Mother
in Rossetti&rsquo;s picture, invited her, and she
slept well. She was awakened at eight o&rsquo;clock
by a young waiter who brought in her coffee
and rolls on a tray. She was a little startled
by his unceremonious entrance, but it seemed
to be so much a matter of course that she
could not resent it. He took the copper jar
away with him. &ldquo;The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> says you will
want some more water,&rdquo; he said smilingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But&mdash;but if you bring it back you
can leave it outside the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coffee was not good, but it was hot, and
the rolls were crisp and delicious, and Olive
ate and drank happily and with an excellent
appetite. No more listening to mangled scales
and murdered nocturnes and sonatas, no more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
interminable meals at which she must sit
silent and yet avoid &ldquo;glumness,&rdquo; no more
walking at Mamie&rsquo;s heels.</p>

<p>She was free!</p>

<p>Presently she said to herself, more soberly,
that nevertheless she must work somehow to
gain her livelihood. Yes, she must find work
soon. The Aquila Verde would shelter and
feed her for six lire a day. Her last month&rsquo;s
salary of eighty lire had been paid her four
days ago, and she had already spent more
than half of it on things she needed, new boots,
an umbrella, gloves, odds and ends. This
month&rsquo;s money had been given her last night,
and she had left a few lire for the servant who
had always brought up her dinner to her
room, and had made Gigia a little present.
The cabman had bullied her into giving him
two lire. She had about one hundred remaining
to her. Sixes into one hundred....
Working it out carefully on the back of an old
envelope she found that she might live on her
means for sixteen days, and then go out into
the streets with four lire in her pocket&mdash;no,
three, since she could scarcely leave without
giving a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mancia</i> to the young man whom she
now heard whistling &ldquo;Lucia&rdquo; in the corridor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hot water, signorina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surely in a few days she would find work.
It occurred to her that she might advertise.
&ldquo;Young English lady would give lessons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Terms moderate. Apply O. A., Aquila Verde.&rdquo;
She wrote it out presently, and took it herself
to the office of one of the local papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have saved fifteen centesimi,&rdquo; she
thought as she walked rather wearily back
by the long Via Cavour.</p>

<p>Three days passed and she was the poorer
by eighteen lire. On Sunday she spent the
morning at the Belle Arti Gallery. Haggard
saints peered out at her from dark corners.
Flora smiled wistfully through her tears;
she saw the three strong archangels leading
boy Tobias home across the hills, and Angelico&rsquo;s
monks and nuns meeting the Blessed Ones in
the green, daisied fields of Paradise, and for a
little while she was able to forget that no one
seemed to want English lessons.</p>

<p>On Monday she decided that she must leave
the Aquila Verde if she could find anyone to
take her for four, or even three lire a day.
She went to Cook&rsquo;s office in the Via Tornabuoni;
it was crowded with Americans come
for their mails, and she had to wait ten
minutes before one of the young men behind
the counter could attend to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you recommend me to a very cheap
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She noticed a faint alteration in his manner,
as though he had lost interest in what she was
saying, but when he had looked at her again he
answered pleasantly, &ldquo;There is Vinella&rsquo;s in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the Piazza Indipendenza, six francs, and there
is another in the Via dei Bardi, I think; but
I will ask. Excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to speak to another clerk at the
cashier&rsquo;s desk. They both stared across at
her, and she fancied she heard the words,
pretty, cheap enough, poor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a place in the Via Decima kept by
a Frau Heylmann. I think it might suit you,
and I will write the address down. It is really
not bad and I can recommend it as I am
staying there myself,&rdquo; he added ingenuously.
He seemed really anxious to help now, and
Olive thanked him.</p>

<p>As she went out she met Prince Tor di Rocca
coming in. Their eyes met momentarily and
he bowed. It seemed strange to her afterwards
when she thought of it, but she fancied
he would have spoken if she had given him an
opportunity. Did he want to explain, to tell
more lies? She had thought him too strong
to care what women thought of him once they
had served him and been cast aside. True,
she was not precisely one of these.</p>

<p>The Via Decima proved to be one of the wide
new streets near the Porta San Gallo. No.
38 was a pretentious house, a tenement
building trying to look like a palace, and it
was plastered over with dingy yellow stucco.
Olive went through the hall into a courtyard
hung with drying linen, and climbed up an
outside iron staircase to the fifth floor. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was a brass plate on the Frau&rsquo;s door, and
Canova&rsquo;s Graces in terra cotta smirked in
niches on either side. The large pale woman
who answered the bell wore a grey flannel
dressing-gown that was almost buttonless,
and her light hair was screwed into an absurdly
small knot on the nape of her neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want to be taken <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en pension</i>? Come
in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She led the way into a bare and chilly
dining-room; the long table was covered
with black American cloth that reminded
Olive of beetles, but everything was excessively
clean. There was a framed photograph
of the Kaiser on the sideboard. In a
room beyond someone was playing the violin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many are you in family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Frau looked down at the gloved hands.
&ldquo;You are not married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman hesitated. &ldquo;You would be out
during the day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Olive said hopefully. &ldquo;I shall
be giving lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, perhaps&mdash;&nbsp;What would you
pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am poor, and I thought you would say as
little as possible. I should be glad to help you
in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a good deal of mending,&rdquo; the
Frau said thoughtfully; &ldquo;and you might clean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
your own room. Shall we say twenty-four
lire weekly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The playing in the other room ceased, and
a young man put his head in at the door.
&ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mutter</i>,&rdquo; he said, and then begged her
pardon, but he did not go away.</p>

<p>Olive tried not to look at him, but he was
staring at her and his eyes were extraordinarily
blue. He was pale, and his wide brows and
strong cleft chin reminded her of Botticelli&rsquo;s
steel-clad archangel. He wore his smooth fair
hair rather long too, in the archangelic manner,
he&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paid in advance,&rdquo; Frau Heylmann said
very sharply. Then she turned upon her son.
&ldquo;What do you want, Wilhelm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can wait,&rdquo; he said easily.</p>

<p>She snorted. &ldquo;I am sorry I cannot receive
you,&rdquo; she said to the girl. &ldquo;I am not
accustomed to have young women in my
house. No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She waddled to the door and Olive followed
her meekly, but she could not keep her lips
from smiling. &ldquo;I do not blame you,&rdquo; she
said as she passed out on to the landing.
&ldquo;Your son is charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman looked at her more kindly now
that she was going. &ldquo;He is beautiful,&rdquo; she
said, with pride. &ldquo;Some day he will be great.
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach!</i> You should hear him play!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive laughed. &ldquo;You would not let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not take this rebuff seriously, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
as she trudged the streets in the thin cold rain
that had fallen persistently all that morning
her sense of humour was blunted by discomfort.
The long dark, stone-paved hall
that was the restaurant of the Aquila Verde
seemed cold and cheerless. At noon it was
always full of hungry men devouring macaroni
and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vitello alla Milanese</i>, and the steam of hot
food and the sound of masticating jaws
greeted Olive as she came in and took her place
at a little table near the stove.</p>

<p>The young waiter, Angelo, brought her a cup
of coffee after the cheese and celery. &ldquo;It
gives courage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I see you need
that to-day, signorina.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>


<p>Olive saw the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> of the Aquila Verde
that night before she went to her room and
told him she was leaving.</p>

<p>His face fell. &ldquo;Signorina! I am sorry!
I told Angelo to bring hot water every time,
always, when you rang. Have you not been
well served?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She reassured him on that point and went
on to explain that she was going to live alone.
&ldquo;I have made arrangements,&rdquo; she added
vaguely. &ldquo;A man will come with a truck
to take my box away to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> was too much a man of
his world to ask any more questions.</p>

<p>There had been no rooms vacant in the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pension</i> in Piazza Indipendenza. The manservant
who answered the door had recommended
an Italian lady who took paying
guests, and Olive had gone to see her, but her
rooms were small, dark and dingy, and they
smelt overpoweringly of sandal wood and rancid
oil. The shabbily-smart <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrona</i> had been
voluble and even affectionate. &ldquo;I am so fond
of the English,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My husband is
much occupied and I am often lonely, but we
shall be able to go out together and amuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ourselves, you and I. I had been hoping to
get an invitation to go to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trecento</i> ball at
the Palazzo Vecchio, but Luigi cannot manage
it. Never mind! We will go to all the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Veglioni</i>. I love dancing.&rdquo; She looked complacently
down at her stubby little feet in
their down-at-heel beaded slippers.</p>

<p>Olive had been glad to get away when she
heard the impossible terms, but the afternoon
was passing, and when she got to the house
in the Via dei Bardi she saw bills of sale
plastered on its walls and a litter of straw and
torn paper in the courtyard. The porter
came out of his lodge to tell her that one of the
daughters had died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They all went away, and the furniture was
sold yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Olive had never really wished to live
and eat with strangers she was not greatly
depressed by these experiences, but she was
cold and tired, and her head ached, and when
on her way back to the Aquila Verde she saw
a card, &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Affitasi, una camera, senza mobilia</i>,&rdquo;
in the doorway of one of the old houses in the
Borgo San Jacopo, she went in and up the long
flight of steep stone stairs without any definite
idea of what she wanted beyond a roof to
shelter her.</p>

<p>A shrivelled, snuffy old woman showed her
the room. It was very large and lofty, and
it had two great arched windows that looked
out upon the huddled roofs of Oltr&rsquo;Arno.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
The brick floor was worn and weather-stained,
as were the white-washed walls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">loggia</i>, but some of the arches
have been filled in and the others glazed. Ten
lire a month, signorina. As to water, there is
a good fountain in the courtyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive moved in next day.</p>

<p>Heaven helps those who help themselves,
she thought, as she borrowed a broom from
her landlady to sweep the floor. The morning
was fine and she opened the windows wide
and let the sun and air in. At noon she went
down into the Borgo and bought fried <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">polenta</i>
for five soldi and a slice of chestnut cake at the
cook shop, and filled her kettle with clear cold
water from the fountain in the courtyard.</p>

<p>Later, as she waited for the water to boil
over her little spirit lamp, she made a list of
absolute necessaries. She had paid a month&rsquo;s
rent in advance, and fifty-three lire remained
to her. Fifty-three lire out of which she must
buy a straw mattress, a camp-stool, two
blankets, some crockery and soap.</p>

<p>She went out presently to do her shopping
and came back at dusk. She was young
enough to rather enjoy the novelty of her
proceedings, and she slept well that night on
the floor, pillowless, and wrapped in her coarse
brown coverings; and though the moon shone
in upon her through the unshuttered windows
for a while she did not dream or wake until the
dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Olive tried very hard to get work in the days
that followed, and she went twice to the
registry office in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you were here before.&rdquo; A stout
woman came bustling out from the room
behind the shop to speak to her the second
time. &ldquo;There is nothing for you, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">signorina
mia</i>. The ladies who come here will not take
anyone without a character, and a written
reference from Milan or Rome is no good. I
told you so before. Last winter Contessa
Foscoli had an English maid with a written
character&mdash;not from us, I am glad to say&mdash;and
she ran away with the chauffeur after a
fortnight, and took a diamond ring and the
Contessa&rsquo;s pearls with her. If you cannot tell
me who you were with last I shall not be able
to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Marchesa Lorenzoni,&rdquo; Olive said.</p>

<p>The woman drew in her breath with a hissing
noise, then she smiled, not pleasantly. &ldquo;Why
did you not say so before? I have heard of
you, of course. The little English girl! Well,
I can&rsquo;t help you, my dear. This is a registry
office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive walked out of the shop at once, but
she heard the woman calling to someone in the
room at the back to come and look at her, and
she felt her cheeks burning as she crossed the
road. &ldquo;The little English girl!&rdquo; What were
they saying about her?</p>

<p>One morning she went into one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
English tea-rooms. It was kept by two
elderly maiden ladies, and one of them came
forward to ask her what she wanted. The
Pagoda was deserted at that hour, a barren
wilderness of little bamboo tables and chairs,
tea-less and cake-less. The walls were distempered
green and sparsely decorated with
Japanese paper fans, and Olive noticed them
and the pattern of the carpet and remembered
them afterwards as one remembers the frieze,
the engravings, the stale periodicals in a
dentist&rsquo;s waiting-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you want a waitress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older woman&rsquo;s face changed. Oh, that
change! The girl knew it so well now that she
saw it ten times a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. My sister and I manage very well,
and we have an Italian maid to do the washing
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Olive said, faltering. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know anyone who wants an English girl?
I have been very well educated. At least&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Olive. She was an unskilled workwoman,
not especially gifted in any way or
fitted by her upbringing to earn her daily
bread. Long years of her girlhood had been
spent at a select school, and in the result she
knew a part of the Book of Kings by heart,
with the Mercy speech from the <i>Merchant of
Venice</i> and the date of the Norman Conquest.
Every day she bought the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Fieramosca</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
she tried to see the other local papers when
they came out. Several people advertised
who wanted to exchange lessons, but no one
seemed inclined to pay. Once she saw names
she knew in the social column.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The Marchese Lorenzoni is going to
Monte Carlo, and he will join the Marchesa and
Miss Whittaker in Cairo later in the season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prince Tor di Rocca is going to Egypt for
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It was easy to read between the lines.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>


<p>Florence, in the great days of the Renaissance,
bore many men whom now she delights
to honour, and Ugo Manelli was one of these.
He helped to build a bridge over the Arno, he
had his palace in the Corso frescoed by
Masaccio, he framed sumptuary laws, and he
wrote sonnets, charming sonnets that are still
read by the people who care for such things.
The fifth centenary of his birthday, on the
twenty-eighth of November, was to be kept
with great rejoicings therefore. There were
to be fireworks and illuminations of the streets
for the people, and a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trecento</i> costume ball
at the Palazzo Vecchio for those who had
influence to procure tickets and money to pay
for them.</p>

<p>Mamie, greatly daring, proclaimed her intention
of wearing the &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">umile ed onesto
sanguigno</i>&rdquo; of Beatrice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be my Dante, Don Filippo?
Momma is going in cloth of gold as Giovanna
degli Albizzi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Marchese looked inquiringly at the
Prince. &ldquo;Shall you add to the gaiety of
nations, or at least of Florence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man shrugged his broad shoulders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; He was well established as
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cavalier servente</i> now in the Lorenzoni household,
and it was understood that Mamie would
be a princess some day. The girl was so
young that the engagement could scarcely
be announced yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we must wait until you are
eighteen, Mamie,&rdquo; her mother said. &ldquo;Keep
him amused and don&rsquo;t be exacting or he&rsquo;ll
quit. He is still sore from his jilting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can manage him,&rdquo; the girl boasted, but
she had no real influence over him now. The
forbidden fruit had allured him, but since it
was his for the gathering it seemed sour&mdash;as
indeed it was, and he was not the man to
allow himself to be tied to the apron-strings of
a child. When he was in a good humour he
watched his future wife amusedly as she
metaphorically and sometimes literally danced
before him, but he discouraged the excess of
audacity that had attracted him formerly,
perhaps because he scarcely relished the idea
of a Princess Tor di Rocca singing, &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">O che la
gioia mi f&egrave; morir</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably he regretted gentle, amenable
Edna. At times he was grimly, impenetrably
silent, and often he said things that would have
wounded a tender heart past healing. Fortunately
there were none such in the Palazzo
Lorenzoni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be ridiculous as the Alighieri, and
you must forgive me, Mamie, if I say that one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
scarcely sees in you a reincarnation of Monna
Beatrice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Red is my colour,&rdquo; the girl answered
rather defiantly.</p>

<p>The Marchese laughed gratingly.</p>

<p>Filippo dined with the Lorenzoni on the
night of the ball. He wore the red <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lucco</i>, but
had declined to crown himself with laurel.
His gaudy Muse, however, had no such
scruples, and her black curls were wreathed
with silver leaves. The Prince was not the
only guest; there was a slender, flaxen-haired
girl from New York dressed after Botticelli&rsquo;s
Judith, an artillery captain as Lorenzo dei
Medici, and another man, a Roman, in the
grey of the order of San Francesco.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poppa left for Monte this morning,&rdquo;
Mamie explained over the soup. &ldquo;He
reckoned dressing up was just foolishness, but
the fact is armour is hot and heavy, and he
would have had to pass from trousers into
greaves. He has not got the right kind of legs
for parti-coloured hosen, someway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Piazza della Signoria was crowded as it
had been on that dreadful May day when
Girolamo&rsquo;s broken body was burnt to ashes
there; as it was on the afternoon of the Pazzi
conspiracy, when a bishop was hanged from
one of the windows of the old Palazzo. But
the old order had changed, giving place to new
even here, and the people had come now
merely to see the fine dresses; there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
thought of murder, though there might be
some picking of pockets. The night was still
and cold, and the white, round moon that had
risen above the roof of the Loggia dei Lanzi
shone, unclouded, upon the restless human
sea that divided here and there to let the
carriages and motors pass. The guests
entered by the side door nearest the Uffizi,
and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri</i> kept the way clear. The
crowd was dense thereabouts, and the people
pushed and jostled one another, leaned
forward, and stood on tiptoe to see the brocaded
ladies in their jewelled coifs and the men,
hooded and strange, in their gay medi&aelig;val
garb.</p>

<p>The Marchesa&rsquo;s cloth of gold drew the
prolonged &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; of admiration that is only
accorded to the better kind of fireworks, and
hearing it, she smiled, well satisfied. Mamie
followed with Filippo. Her dress of rose-coloured
brocade was exquisite. It clung to
her and seemed to be her one and only garment;
one could almost see the throb of her heart
through the thin stuff. She let her furred
cloak fall as she got out of the car and then
drew it up again about her bare arms and
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the black-curled scarlet thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beatrice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! half naked! She is more like one
of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">donnine</i> in the <i>Decameron</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her Dante, overhearing, hurried her up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
steps. His eyes were bright with anger in
the shadow of his hood, but they changed and
darkened as he caught sight of one girl&rsquo;s face
in the crowd. At the foot of the grand staircase
he turned, muttering some excuse and
leaving Mamie and her mother to go up alone,
and hurried back and out into the street. He
stood aside as though to allow some newcomers
to pass in. The girl he had come to
see was close to him, but she was half hidden
behind a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabiniere&rsquo;s</i> broad epauletted
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scusi</i>,&rdquo; murmured the Prince as he leant
across the man to pull at her sleeve. &ldquo;I
must see you,&rdquo; he said urgently. &ldquo;When?
Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you like,&rdquo; she answered, but her
eyes were startled as they met his. &ldquo;No.
27 Borgo San Jacopo. The only door on the
sixth landing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. To-night, then, and in an
hour&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The press of incoming masqueraders screened
them. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabiniere</i> knew the Prince by
sight, and he listened with all his might, but
they spoke English, and he dared not turn to
stare at the girl until the tall figure in the red
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lucco</i> had passed up the steps and gone in
again, and by that time she had slipped away
out of sight.</p>

<p>Filippo came to the Borgo a little before
midnight and crossed the dingy threshold of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
No. 27 as the bells of the churches rang out the
hour. The old street was quiet enough now
but for the wailing of some strayed and starving
cats that crept about the shadowed courts
and under the crumbling archways, and the
departing cab woke strange echoes as it rattled
away over the cobble stones.</p>

<p>The only door on the sixth landing was
open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Filippo said,
wonderingly, as he groped his way in. The
room was in utter darkness but for one ray of
moonlight athwart it and the faint light of
the stars, by which he saw Olive leaning
against the sill of one of the unshuttered
windows, and looking, as it seemed, towards
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You need not be
afraid of falling over the furniture. There is
not much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem partial to bare attics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! you are thinking of my room in the
Vicolo dei Moribondi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said as he came towards her
from the door. &ldquo;I cannot rest, I cannot forget.
For God&rsquo;s sake tell me about the end! I
have been to Siena since I heard, but I dared
not ask too many questions. Was she&mdash;did
she suffer very much before she died?
Answer me quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw back your hood,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let
me see your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Impatiently he thrust the folds of white
and scarlet away and stood bare-headed. She
saw that his strong lips quivered and that his
eyes were contracted with pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she died instantly. They said at the
inquest that it must have been so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her face&mdash;was she&mdash;&rdquo; his voice broke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not see it. It was covered by a
handkerchief,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!
Don&rsquo;t! I did not think you would suffer so
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suffer horribly day and night. Love is
the scourge of the world in the hands of the
devil. That is certain. She is buried near
the south wall of the Campo Santo. Oh, God!
when I think of her sweet flesh decaying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive, scarcely knowing what she did, caught
at his hand and held it tightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, oh, hush!&rdquo; she said tremulously.
She felt as though she were seeing him racked.
&ldquo;I do believe that her soul was borne into
heaven, God&rsquo;s heaven, on the day she died.
She was forgiven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Where is heaven?
I am not guilty of her death. She was a fool
to die, and I shall not soon forgive her for leaving
me so. If she came back I would punish
her, torment her, make her scream with pain&mdash;if
she came back&mdash;oh, Gemma!&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carissima</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hard, hot eyes filled with tears. He
tried to drag his hand away, but the girl held
it fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
&ldquo;You are kind and good,&rdquo; he said presently
in a changed voice. &ldquo;I am sorry if I did you
any harm with the Lorenzoni, but the woman
told me she meant to send you away in any
case because of the Marchese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as he felt the clasp of her fingers
loosening about his wrist, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let go,&rdquo; he
said quickly. &ldquo;Is he really going to take you
to Monte Carlo with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does his wife say so? Do you believe
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He answered deliberately. &ldquo;No, not now.
But you cannot go on living like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was right. She could not go on. Her
little store of coppers was dwindling fast, so
fast that the beggars at the church doors
would soon be richer than she was. And she
was tired of her straits, tired of coarse food
and a bare lodging, and of the harsh, clamorous
life of the streets. The yoke of poverty was
very heavy.</p>

<p>Filippo drew a little nearer to her. &ldquo;I
could make you love me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no answer in words but he caught
her to him. She lay for a moment close in
his arms, her heart beating on his, before she
cried to him to let her go.</p>

<p>He released her instantly. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must light the lamp,&rdquo; she said unsteadily.
She was afraid now to be alone with him in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
dim, starlit room, and she fumbled for the
matches. He stood still by the window
waiting until the little yellow flame of the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lucerna</i> burnt brightly on the floor between
them, then he smiled at her, well pleased at her
pallor. &ldquo;You see it would be easy,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>She answered nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to Naples to-morrow by the
afternoon train. Will you come with me?
We will go where you like from there, to Capri,
or to Sicily; and you will help me to forget,
and I will teach you to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was silence between them for a while.
Olive stared with fascinated eyes at this tall,
lithe man whose red <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lucco</i>, falling in straight
folds to his feet, became him well. The upper
part of his face was in shadow, and she saw
only the strong lines of the cleft chin, and the
beautiful cruel lips that smiled at her as though
they knew what her answer must be.</p>

<p>She was of those who are apt to prefer one
hour of troubled joy to the long, grey, eventless
years of the women who are said to be happy
because they have no history, and it seemed
to her that the moment had come when she
must make a choice. This love was not what
she had dreamed of, longed for; other lips,
kinder and more true, should have set their
seal on her accomplished womanhood. She
knew that this that was offered was a perilous
and sharp-edged thing, a bright sheath that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
held a sword for her heart, and yet that heart
sang exultantly as it fluttered like a wild bird
against the bars of its cage. It sang of youth
and life and joy that cares not for the morrow.</p>

<p>It sang.</p>

<p>Filippo watched her closely and he saw that
she was yielding. Her lips parted, and instinctively
as he came towards her she closed
her eyes so nearly that he saw only a narrow
line of blue gleaming between her lashes.
But as he laid his hands upon her shoulders
something awoke within her, a terror that
screamed in her ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she said brokenly. &ldquo;Leave
me and come back to-morrow morning if you
will. I cannot answer you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he still held her she spoke again. &ldquo;If I
come to you willingly I shall be more worth
having, and if you do not go now I will never
come. I will drown myself in the Arno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I will come to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he was gone she went stumblingly
across the room to the mattress on the floor
in the farthest corner, and threw herself down
upon it, dressed as she was.</p>

<p>There was no more oil in the little lamp, and
its flame flickered and went out after a while,
leaving her in the dark. The clocks were
striking two. Long since the moon had set
behind the hills and now the stars were fading,
or so it seemed. There was no light anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Olive did not sleep. Her frightened
thoughts ran to and fro busily, aimlessly, like
ants disturbed, hither and thither, this way
and that. He could give her so much.
Nothing real, indeed, but many bright counterfeits.
For a while she would seem to be cared
for and beloved. Yes, but if the true love
came she would be shamed. She knew that
her faith in Dante&rsquo;s Amor, his lord of terrible
aspect, made his coming possible. The men
and women who go about proclaiming that
there is no such person because they have
never seen him were born blind. Like those
prosy souls who call the poets mad, they
mistake impotence for common sense.</p>

<p>Besides, the first step always costs so dear,
and now that he was gone and she could think
of him calmly she knew that she was afraid
of Filippo Tor di Rocca. He was cruel.
Then among the forces arrayed against him
there was the desire of that she called her
soul to mortify her flesh, to beckon, to lead
by stony ways to the heights of sacrifice.
She could not be sure where that first step
would lead her, she could not be sure of herself
or gauge the depths to which she might
fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; she said aloud. &ldquo;Help me!
Don&rsquo;t let things be too difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hours of darkness were long, but the
grey glimmering dawn came at last with a
pattering of rain against the uncurtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
window. Olive rose as soon as it was light,
and before eight she had eaten the crust of
bread she had saved for her breakfast and
was gone out. On her way down the stairs
she met her landlady and spoke to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anyone comes to see me will you tell
them that I have gone out, and that I do not
know when I shall come in again. And if
anything is said about my going away you can
say that I have changed my mind and that I
shall not leave Florence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would not cross the river for fear of
meeting Filippo in any of the more-frequented
streets on the other side, so she went down the
Via della Porta Romana and out by the gates
into the open country beyond. She walked
for a long time along muddy roads between the
high walls of vineyards and olive orchards.
She had an umbrella, but her skirts were
draggled and splashed with mire and the water
came through the worn soles of her thin shoes.
She had nothing to eat and no money to buy
food. There were some coppers in her purse,
but she had forgotten to bring that. It was
windy, and as she was toiling up the steep hill
to Bellosguardo her umbrella blew inside out.
She threw it down by the side of the road and
went on, rather glad to be rid of it and to feel
the rain on her face. She had two hands now
to hold her skirt and that was better. Soon
after noon she knocked at the door of a
gardener&rsquo;s cottage and asked for something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to eat; she was given a yellow lump of
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">polenta</i> and a handful of roast chestnuts
and she sat down on a low wall by the roadside
to devour them. She did not think much
about anything now, she could not even feel
that she cared what happened to her, but she
adhered to the resolution she had made to
keep out of the way until Tor di Rocca had
left Florence. She could not sit long. It was
cold and she was poorly clad, so poorly that
the woman in the cottage had believed her
to be a beggar. The Prince would have had
to buy her clothes before he could take her
away with him.</p>

<p>She wandered about until nightfall and then
made her way back to the house in the Borgo,
footsore and cold and wretched, but still the
captain of her soul; ragged, but free and in no
man&rsquo;s livery.</p>

<p>The landlady heard her coming slowly up
the stairs and came out of her room to speak
to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentleman called for you this morning.
I told him you were gone out and that you had
changed your mind about leaving Florence,
and at first he seemed angry, and then he
laughed. &lsquo;Tell her we shall meet again,&rsquo;
he said. Then another came this afternoon
in an automobile and asked if you lived here,
and when I said you were out he said he
would come again this evening. He left his
card.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Olive looked at it with dazed eyes. Her
pale face flushed, but as she went on up the
stairs the colour ebbed away until even her
lips were white. She had to rest twice before
she could reach her own landing, and when
she had entered her room she could go no
farther than the door. She fell, and it was
some time before she could get up again, but
she still held the card crumpled in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean Avenel.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>


<p>The Villa Fiorelli is set high among the olive
groves above the village of Settignano. There
are Medicean balls on a shield over the great
wrought-iron gates, and the swarthy splendid
banker princes appear as the Magi in the faded
fresco painting of the Nativity in the chapel.
They have knelt there in the straw of the
stable of Bethlehem for more than four hundred
years. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nobili</i> of Florence were used to
loiter long ago on the terrace in the shade of
the five cypresses, and women, famous or
infamous, but always beautiful, listened to
sonnets said and songs sung in their honour
in the scented idleness of the rose garden. The
villa belonged first to handsome, reckless
Giuliano, the lover of Simonetta and others,
and the father of a Pope, and when the
dagger thrusts of the Pazzi put an end to his
short life his elder brother and lord, Lorenzo,
held it for a while before he sold it to the
Salviati. So it passed through many hands
until at last Hilaire Avenel bought it and
filled it with the books and armour that he
loved. There were Spanish suits, gold-chased,
in the hall, Moorish swords and lances,
and steel hauberks on the staircase, and stray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
arquebuses, greaves and gauntlets everywhere.
They were all rather dusty, since
Hilaire was unmarried; but he was well
served nevertheless. He was not a sociable
person, and no Florentine had ever partaken
of a meal with him, but it was currently reported
that he sat through a ten-course
dinner every night of his life, crumbling the
bread at the side of his plate, and invariably
refusing to partake of nine of the dishes that
were handed in form by the old butler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s real mean of your brother to keep his
lovely garden shut up all through the spring,&rdquo;
the Marchesa Lorenzoni had said once to Jean,
and he had replied, &ldquo;Well, it is his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That seemed final, but the present Marchesa
and late relict of Jonas P. Whittaker of Pittsburg
was not so easily put off. She was apt
to motor up to Settignano more than once in
the May month of flowers; the intractable
Hilaire was never at home to her, but she
revenged herself by multitudinous kind inquiries.
He was an invalid, but he disliked to
be reminded of his infirmities almost as much
as he did most women and all cackle about the
weather.</p>

<p>Jean lived with him when not playing
Chopin at the ends of the earth, and when the
two were together the elder declared himself
to be perfectly happy. &ldquo;I only want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your first editions and your Cellini
helmet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
When Jean came back from his American
tour his brother was quick to notice a change
in him, and when on the day after his Florentine
concert he came in late for a dinner which
he ate in silence, Hilaire spoke his mind. They
were together in the library. Jean had taken
a book down from the shelves but he was not
reading it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hilaire was watching his brother&rsquo;s face.
It seemed to him that there were lines in it
that he had not seen before, and the brown
eyes that gazed so intently into the fire were
surely very tired.</p>

<p>He began again rather awkwardly. &ldquo;You
have been here a week, Jean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the concert go off well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well enough. As usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went away alone in the Itala car
before nine this morning and you came back
scarcely an hour ago. What is the matter?
Is there some new trouble? Jean, dear man,
I am older than you; I have only you. What
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean reached out for his tobacco pouch.
&ldquo;Hilaire,&rdquo; he said very gravely, after a pause,
which he occupied in filling his pipe. &ldquo;You
remember I asked you to do anything, anything,
for a girl named Olive Agar. You have never
heard from her or of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I have been to Siena.
There was some affair&mdash;early in September
she came to Florence, to the Lorenzoni of all
people in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hilaire whistled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; the younger man said
gloomily, as though he had spoken. &ldquo;That
woman! What she must have suffered in
these months! Well, she left them suddenly
at the beginning of November.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did she leave Siena?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was some trouble&mdash;a bad business,&rdquo;
he answered reluctantly. &ldquo;She lived with
some cousins, and one of them committed
suicide. She came away to escape the horror
and all the talk, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I need not ask why she left the
Lorenzoni woman. No girl in her senses
would stay an hour longer than she could help
with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hilaire, I think I half hoped to see her
at the concert yesterday. When I came on
the platform I looked for her, and I am sure I
should have seen her in that crowd if she had
been there. She is different, somehow. I
played like a machine for the first time in my
life, I think, and during the interval the
manager asked me why I had not given the
nocturne that was down on the programme.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
I said something about a necessary alteration
at the last moment, but I don&rsquo;t know now
what I did play. I was thinking of her. A
girl alone has a bad time in this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to find her? Is she in love
with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean flushed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. What I really wanted
to know was if you cared for her. I see you
do. Oh, Lord!&rdquo; The older man sighed
heavily as he put down his coffee-cup. &ldquo;I
wish you would play to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean went into the music-room, leaving the
folding doors between open, and sat down at
the piano. There was no light but the moon&rsquo;s,
and Hilaire saw the beloved head dark against
the silvery grey of the wall beyond. The
skilled hands let loose a torrent of harmonies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn women!&rdquo; said Hilaire, under cover
of the fortissimo.</p>

<p>He spent some hours in the library on the
following day re-arranging and dusting his
books, lingering over them, reading a page
here and there, patting their old vellum-bound
backs fondly before he returned them to their
shelves. They absorbed him, and yet the
footman bringing in his tea on a tray heard
him saying, &ldquo;I must not worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean had always come to him with his
troubles ever since he was a child, and the
worst of all had been brought about by a
woman. That was years ago now. Hilaire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
had been away from England, and he had
come back to find his brother aged and
altered&mdash;and married.</p>

<p>They had got on so well together without
women in these latter years that Hilaire had
hoped they might live and die in peace, but it
seemed that it was not to be. Jean had gone
out again in the car to look for his Olive.
Well, if she made him happy Hilaire thought
they might get on very well after all. But
he had forebodings, and later, he sat
frowning at the white napery and glittering
glass and silver reflected in the polished
walnut wood of his well-appointed table, and
he refused soup and fish with unnecessary
violence. Jean loved this girl and she could
make him happy if she would, but would she?
She was evidently not of a &ldquo;coming-on disposition&rdquo;;
she was good, and Jean was,
unfortunately, still married to the other.</p>

<p>It had been raining all day. The wind
moaned in the trees and sighed in the chimney,
and now and again the blazing logs on the
hearth hissed as drops fell on them from
above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a good fire in the signorino&rsquo;s
dressing-room, I hope. He has been out all
day, and it is so stormy that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The signorino has come in, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">eccellenza</i>.
He&mdash;he brought a lady with him. She seemed
faint and ill, and I sent for the gardener&rsquo;s wife
to come and look after her. I have given her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the blue room, and the housekeeper is with
her now. She was busy with the dinner when
she first came.&rdquo; The old butler rubbed his
hands together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I did right,&rdquo; he said after a pause.</p>

<p>Hilaire roused himself. &ldquo;Oh, quite right,
of course. She will want something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have sent up a tray&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;here he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man drew back as Jean came in.
&ldquo;I am sorry to be late, Hilaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereafter both sat patiently waiting for
the end of a dinner that seemed age-long.
When, at last, they were alone Jean rose to
his feet; he was very pale and his brown eyes
glittered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Stefano tell you? I have found her
and brought her here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she has come, has she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think less of her for that. Ah, you
will misjudge her until you know her. Wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>Hilaire stood on the hearth with his back to
the fire. He repeated his formula, but there
was a not unkindly light in his tired eyes,
and when presently the door was opened and
the girl came in he smiled.</p>

<p>The club foot, of which he was nervously
conscious at times, held him to his place, but
she came forward until she was close to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
&ldquo;You are his brother,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I&mdash;what
a good fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knelt down on the bear skin and
stretched her hands to the blaze. Hilaire
noticed that she was excessively thin; the
rose-flushed cheeks were hollow and the curves
of the sweet cleft chin too sharp. He looked
at her as she crouched at his feet; the nape
of the slim neck showed a very pure white
against the shabby black of her dress, there
were fine threads of gold in the soft brown
tangle of her hair.</p>

<p>Jean was dragging one of the great armchairs
closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are cold,&rdquo; he said anxiously. &ldquo;Come
and sit here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose obediently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had any dinner?&rdquo; asked
Hilaire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; they brought me some soup in my
room. I am not hungry now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke very simply, like a child. Jean had
rifled all the other chairs to provide her with
a sufficiency of cushions, and now he brought
her a footstool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I must take my shoes off,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;So cold&mdash;you see they let the water
in, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take them off at once,&rdquo; ordered Hilaire,
and he watched, still with that faint smile in
his eyes, as Jean knelt to do his bidding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very nice,&rdquo; sighed the girl. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
never knew before that real happiness is just
having lots to eat and being warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often wondered about you,&rdquo; she
said to Hilaire presently. &ldquo;Your eyes are
just like his. I think if I had known that I
should have had to come before; but you see I
promised Cardinal Jacopo of Portugal&mdash;in
San Miniato&mdash;that I would not. What am I
talking about?&rdquo; Her voice broke and she
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; Jean would have gone
to her, but his brother laid a restraining hand
on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave her alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She will be
all right to-morrow. It&rsquo;s only excitement,
nervous exhaustion. She must rest and eat.
Wait quietly and don&rsquo;t look at her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean moved restlessly about the room;
Hilaire, gravely silent, seemed to see nothing.</p>

<p>So the two men waited until the girl was
able to control her sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; she said presently. &ldquo;I
have made you uncomfortable; forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take a brandy-and-soda if I give
it you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you think it will do me good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hilaire limped across to the sideboard.
He was scarcely gone half a minute, but when
he came back with a glass of the mixture he
had prescribed he saw his brother kneeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
at the girl&rsquo;s side, his arms about her, his face
hidden in the folds of her skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean! Get up!&rdquo; he said very sharply.
&ldquo;Pull yourself together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive sat stiffly erect; her swollen, tear-stained
lids hid the blue eyes, her pale, quivering
lips formed words that were inaudible.</p>

<p>Hilaire ground his teeth. &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a while the lover loosed his hold; he
bent to kiss the girl&rsquo;s feet; then he rose and
went silently out of the room. Hilaire
listened for the closing of another door before
he rang the bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>


<p>For some days and nights Olive lived only to
eat and sleep. When she woke it was to hear
a kind old voice urging her to take hot milk
or soup, to see a kind old face framed in white
hair set off by black lace lappets; and yet
whenever she closed her eyes at first she was
aware of a passionate aching echo of words said
that was sad as the sound of the sea in a shell.
&ldquo;I love you&mdash;I love you&mdash;&rdquo; until at last sleep
helped to knit up the ravelled sleave of
care.</p>

<p>Every morning there were fresh roses for
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The signorino hopes you are better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, much better, thank you.&rdquo; And after
a while a day came when she felt really strong
enough to get up. She dressed slowly and
came down and out on to the terrace. The
crumbling stones of the balustrade were moss-grown,
as was the slender body of the bronze
Mercury, poised for flight and dark against
the pale illimitable blue of the December sky.
Hilaire Avenel never tried to make Nature
neat; the scarlet leaves of the Virginia creeper
came fluttering down and were scattered on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the worn black and white mosaic of the pavement;
they showed like fire flickering in the
sombre green of the cypresses. Beyond and
below the garden, the olive and ilex woods,
and the steep red roofs of Settignano, lay
Florence, a city of the plain, and wreathed in
a delicate mist. There was the great dome
of Santa Maria dei Fiori; the tortuous silver
streak that was Arno, spanned by her bridges;
there was Giotto&rsquo;s tower, golden-white and rose
golden, there the campanile of the Badia, the
grim old Bargello, and the battlemented walls
of the Palazzo Vecchio; farther still, across
the river, the heights of San Miniato al Monte,
Bellosguardo, and Mont&rsquo; Oliveto, cypress
crowned.</p>

<p>Two white rough-coated sheep-dogs came
rushing up the steps from the garden to greet
Olive with sharp barks of joy, and Hilaire was
not slow to follow. Olive still thought him
very like his brother, an older and greyer
Jean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been so looking forward to showing
you the garden,&rdquo; he said hurriedly in his kind
eagerness to put her at her ease. &ldquo;There
are still a few late chrysanthemums, and you
will find blue and white violets in the grass by
the sundial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed down the steps together and
through the green twilight of the orange
groves, and came to a little fountain in the
midst of a space of lawn set about with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
laurels. Hilaire threw a biscuit into the
pool, and the dark water gleamed with silver
and gold as the fish rushed at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I flatter myself that all the living things
in this garden know me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I bar
the plainer kinds of insects and scorpions, of
course; but the small green lizards are charming,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamie Whittaker had one on a gold chain.
She used to wear it sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would,&rdquo; he said drily. &ldquo;The young
savage! Better go naked than torture harmless
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This place is perfect,&rdquo; sighed Olive; and
then, &ldquo;You have no home in France?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should have; but our great-grandfather
was guillotined in Paris during the
Terror, and his wife and child came to England.
Years later, when they might have
gone back they would not. Why should
they? Napoleon had given the Avenel
estates to one of his ruffians, who had since
seceded to the Bourbon and so made all secure.
Besides, they were happy enough. Marie
Louis Hilaire gave music lessons, and the
Marquise scrubbed and cooked and patched
their clothes&mdash;she, who had been the Queen&rsquo;s
friend, and so they managed to keep the little
home together. Presently the young man
married, and then Jean Marie appeared on the
scene. We have a picture of him at the age
of five, in a nankeen frock and a frill. Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
mother was a Hungarian&mdash;hence Jean&rsquo;s music,
I suppose&mdash;and there is Romany blood on
that side. These are our antecedents. You
will not be surprised at our vagaries now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive smiled. &ldquo;No, I shall remember the
red heels of Versailles, English bread and
butter, and the gipsy caravan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean has fetched your books from the
Monte di Piet&agrave;. Marietta found the tickets
in your coat pocket. You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking at her he saw her eyes fill with
tears, and he hurried on: &ldquo;No rubbish, I
notice. Are you fond of reading?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if you would care to
undertake a work for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to do anything,&rdquo; she said
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some thousands of books in the
villa. Those I have collected myself I know&mdash;they
are all in the library&mdash;but there are
many that were left me by my father, and
others that came from an uncle, and they
are all piled up in heaps in the empty rooms
on the second floor. I want someone to sort
them out, catalogue, and arrange them for
me. Would you care to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right then,&rdquo; he said hastily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a carpenter in at once to put up some
more shelves ready for them. And I think
you had better stay on in the villa, if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t mind. It will be more convenient.
The salary will be two hundred lire a month,
paid in advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your kindness&mdash;I can&rsquo;t express my gratitude&mdash;&rdquo;
she began tremulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! This is a business transaction,
and I am coming out of it very well. I
should not get a man to do the work for that
absurdly small sum. I am underpaying you
on purpose because I hate women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive laughed. &ldquo;Commend me to misogynists
henceforth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wanted to begin at once, but her host
assured her that he would rather she waited
until the shelves were put up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have to sort them out several
times, according to date, language and subject.
Perhaps Jean can help you when he
returns. He is away just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Watching her, he saw the deepening of the
rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what happened
the night I came, Mr Avenel. You
know I had not been able to find work, and
though my <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrona</i> was kind she was very
poor too. She pawned my things for me,
but they fetched so little, and I had not had
anything to eat for ever so long when he came.
He has not gone away because of me, has
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hilaire threw the fish another biscuit; it
fell among the lily leaves at the feet of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the weather-stained marble nymph of the
fountain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must decline to answer,&rdquo; he said gravely,
after a pause. &ldquo;I understand that you are
twenty-three and old enough therefore to
judge for yourself, and I do not intend to
influence either you or Jean, if I can help it.
You will be perfectly free to do exactly what
you think right, my dear girl. I will only
give you one bit of advice, and that is, look
at life with your eyes wide open. Don&rsquo;t
blink! This is Friday, and Jean is coming to
see you on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>


<p>Olive told herself that Hilaire was very good
to her in the days that followed. He came
sometimes into the room where she was, to
find her sitting on the floor amid the piles of
books she was trying to reduce to some kind of
order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not get tired? I am afraid they
are rather dusty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not at all,&rdquo; she assured him. She
was swathed in a blue linen apron of Marietta&rsquo;s
and had tied a cotton handkerchief over her
hair. &ldquo;I like to feel I am doing something
for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish&mdash;you have been&mdash;you
are so kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the Wednesday morning she covered
some of the books with brown paper and
pasted labels on their backs. She tried not
to listen for the creaking of the great gates as
they swung open, for the grating of wheels
against the stones, for Jean&rsquo;s voice calling to
his brother, for his quick step upon the stair,
but she heard all as she wrote <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vita Nuova</i> on
the slip intended for an early edition of the
<i>Rape of the Lock</i>, and put the <i>Decameron</i>
aside with some sermons and commentaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
that were to be classified as devotional literature.
He did not come to her then, but she
was desperately afraid that he might. &ldquo;I
am not ready ... not ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>When, later, she came into the dining-room
she seemed to be perfectly at her ease. Jean&rsquo;s
eyes had been fixed on the door, and they met
hers eagerly as she came forward. &ldquo;Are
you better?&rdquo; he asked, and then bit his lip,
thinking he had said the wrong thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. But&mdash;but you look pale and
thinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her little air of gay indifference fell away
from her. As he still held her hand she felt
the tears coming and longed to be able to run
upstairs and take some more sal volatile, but
Hilaire came to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have lunch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
hate tepid food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they had taken their places Jean
gave the girl a letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came for you to the Lorenzoni. I
called at the porter&rsquo;s lodge this morning and
Ser Gigia gave it me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a waste of good things I never saw,&rdquo;
the butler said afterwards to his wife. &ldquo;As
you know, the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">padrone</i> never eats more than
enough to fill a bird, but I have seen the
signorino hungry, and the young lady too.
To-day, however, they ate nothing, though
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">frittata</i> was fit to melt in one&rsquo;s mouth. I
should not have been ashamed to set it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
before the Archangel Gabriel, and he would
have eaten it, since it is certain that the
Blessed One has never been in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the meal, to which no one indeed
had done justice, Hilaire explained that he
was going to write some letters.</p>

<p>The younger man looked at Olive. &ldquo;Come
with me,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;I want to
play to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to hear you,&rdquo; she said as she rose
from the table.</p>

<p>He followed her into the music-room and
shut the door. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She chose to misunderstand him. &ldquo;It is
charming. Just what a shrine of sound
should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grand piano stood out from the grey-green
background of the walls beyond, there
was a bronze statuette of Orpheus with his
lute on a twisted Byzantine column of white
and gold mosaic, and a long cushioned divan
set on one side broke the long lines of light on
the polished floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to play?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, at present,&rdquo; he said, smiling at
her. &ldquo;I want to talk to you first. You are
not frightened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She sat on the divan and he stood
before her, looking down into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I had better try to tell you about
my wife,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I sit here? And
may I smoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She drew her skirts aside to make
room for him next to her. &ldquo;I want to hear
you,&rdquo; she said again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imagine me, a boy of twenty-two, convalescing
in country lodgings after an illness
that seemed to have taken the marrow out
of my bones. Hilaire was in Japan, and I&mdash;a
callow fledgling from the nest&mdash;was very
sick and sorry for myself. There were some
people living in rather a large house at the
other end of the village who took notice of me.
They were the only ones, and I have thought
since that my acquaintance with them really
did for me with everyone else. They were
not desirable&mdash;but&mdash;well, I was too young,
and just then too physically weak to avoid
their more pressing attentions. Old Seldon
was one of those flushed, swollen men whose
collars seem always to be too small for them.
He tried to be pleasant, but it was not a great
success. There were two daughters at home,
and Gertrude was the eldest. She had been
married, and the man had died, leaving her
penniless. As you may suppose she had not
come back to veal. I was sorry for her then
because she seemed a good sort, and she was
very kind to me; she was five years my
senior&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Olive said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to go to the house nearly every
evening. She sang well, and I used to play
her accompaniments, while the old man hung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
about the sideboard. He never left us alone,
and the younger girl, Violet, used to meet the
rector&rsquo;s son in the stables then. I heard that
afterwards. They lived anyhow, and owed
money to all the tradespeople round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One night I was awakened by a knocking
outside; my landlady slept at the back, and
she was deaf besides, so I went down myself.
The wind put my candle out as I opened the
door, but I saw a woman standing there in
the rain, and I asked her what she wanted.
She made no answer, but pushed past me into
the passage, and went into my sitting-room.
I followed, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps you have guessed that it was
Gertrude. Her yellow hair hung down and
about her face; she was only half dressed,
and her bare arms and shoulders were all
wet. Her skirts were torn and stained with
mud. She told me her father had turned her
out of the house in a drunken fury and she had
come to me. Even then I wondered why she
had not gone to some woman&mdash;surely she might
have found shelter&mdash;however, she had come
to me. I was going to call up my landlady,
but she would not allow it because she said
that no one but I need ever know. She would
creep home through the fields soon after
sunrise and her sister would let her in. The
old man would be sleeping heavily.... The
end of it was that I let her go up to my room
while I lay on the sofa in the little parlour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
The horsehair bolster was deucedly hard, but
I was young, and when I did get off I slept
well. When I woke it was nearer eight than
seven, and I had just scrambled up when my
landlady came in. One look at her face was
enough. I understood that Gertrude had
overslept herself too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sequel was hateful. There was a
frightful scandal, of course; the father raved,
the women cried, the rector talked to me
seriously, and&mdash;Olive, mark this&mdash;Gertrude
would not say anything. I married her and
we came away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a trap,&rdquo; cried Olive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had not one single thing in common,
and you know when there is no love sex is
a barrier set up by the devil between human
souls. After some years of mutual misery I
brought her here. Poor Hilaire has hated
respectable women ever since&mdash;she was that, if
that counts when there is nothing else. Just
virtue, with no saving graces. She is living in
London now, is much esteemed, and regularly
exceeds her allowance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean had let his pipe go out, and now he
relit it. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose so.
Frizzy hair and all that. I fancy she has
grown stout now. She is the kind that
spreads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life is all so hateful,&rdquo; sighed the girl.
Jean moved away from her and went to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
window. Hilaire was limping across the
terrace towards the garden steps. When he
was gone out of sight Jean came back into
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother is unhappy too. The woman
he loved died. Oh, Olive, are we to be lonely
always because the law will not give me a
divorce from the woman who was never really
my wife, never dear to me or near to me as
you are? Joy is within our reach, a golden
rose on the tree of life, and it is for you to
gather it or to hold your hand. Don&rsquo;t answer
me yet for God&rsquo;s sake. Wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the piano and opened it.</p>

<p>Rain ... rain dripping on the roof through
the long hours of night, and the weary moaning
of the wakeful wind. Thronging memories
of past years, past youth, past joy, past
laughter echoing and re-echoing in one man&rsquo;s
hungry heart. Light footsteps of children
never to be born ... and then the heavy
tread of men carrying a coffin, and the last
sound of all&mdash;the clanging of an iron door....</p>

<p>The grave ... the grave ... it held the
boy who had loved her, and presently, surely,
it would hold this man too, sealing his kind
lips with earth, closing his brown eyes in an
eternal darkness.</p>

<p>He played, as thousands had said, divinely,
not only with his hands but with his soul.
The music that had been a work of genius
became a miracle when he interpreted it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
indeed it seemed that virtue went out of him.
His face was drawn and pale and a pulse beat
in his cheek. Olive, gazing at him through
a blur of tears, knew that she had never longed
for anything in her life as she longed now to
comfort this pain expressed in ripples, and low
murmurings, and great crashing waves of the
illimitable sea of sound. Her heart ached
with the pity that is a woman&rsquo;s way of loving,
and as he left the piano she rose too. He
uttered a sort of cry as she swayed towards
him, and clasped her in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said, his lips so close to
hers that she felt rather than heard the
words.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>


<p>Jean came to the villa a little before noon on
the following day. Hilaire, who was in the
library, heard his voice in the hall calling the
dogs, heard him whistling some little song
tune as he opened and shut all the doors one
after the other.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">O l&rsquo;amor e&rsquo; come un nocciuola</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Se non se apre non si pu&ograve; mangiarla&mdash;</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Hilaire, where are you? I thought I
should find you on the terrace this fine morning.
Where is she?&rdquo; he added eagerly as he
laid a great bunch of roses down on the table.
&ldquo;Is her headache better? Has not she come
down yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked across the room to where his
brother&rsquo;s grey head just showed above the
high carved back of his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hilaire! Why don&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the silence that ensued he distinctly heard
the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece
and the falling of the soft wood ashes in the
grate; the beating of his own heart sounded
loud to him. One of the dogs was scratching
at the door and whining to be let in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hilaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
&ldquo;She is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. She left this letter for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, give it to me.&rdquo; He opened and read
it hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you meant dead at first,&rdquo; he
said. His brown eyes had lost the light that
had been in them and were melancholy as
before; he stood still by the table looking
down upon his roses. They would fade, and
she would never see them now. Never ...
never ...</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and sit by the fire and let&rsquo;s talk it over
quietly,&rdquo; said Hilaire. &ldquo;Oh, damn women,&rdquo;
he mumbled as he drew at his pipe&mdash;the fifth
that morning. It was the first time in a
week that he had uttered his pet expletive.
&ldquo;What does she say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can read her letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would she mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Jean said bitterly. &ldquo;She loves
you&mdash;what she calls loving&mdash;next best after
me. She told me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hilaire carefully smoothed the crumpled,
blotted page out on his knee.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Jean</span>,&mdash;I am going away
because I am a coward. I dare not live with
you, and I dare not ask you to forgive me.
Last night as I lay awake I thought and
thought about my feeling for you and I was
sure that it was love. I used to think of you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
often last summer and to wonder where you
were and what you were doing, and I hoped
you had not forgotten me. I did not love you
then, but I suppose my thoughts of you kept
my heart&rsquo;s door open for you, and certainly
they helped to keep out someone else who
came and tried to get admittance. Oh, one
must suffer to keep love perfect, but isn&rsquo;t it
worth while? You may not believe me now
when I say that if I cared for you less I should
stay, but it is true. Oh, Jean, even when we
were so happy for a few minutes yesterday
something in me looked beyond into the years
to come and was afraid. Not of you; I trust
you, dearest; but of the world. Men would
stare at me and laugh and whisper together,
and women would look away, and I know I
should not be able to bear it. I am not brave
like that. Oh, every word I write must hurt
you, I know. Remember that I love you
now and shall always. Good-bye.&mdash;Your</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Olive</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I should keep this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to. Hilaire, did you know she
was going? Did she tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older man answered quietly: &ldquo;Yes,
I knew, and I sent her to the station in the
motor. I had promised a strict neutrality,
Jean, and she was right to go. Some women,
good women, may be strong enough to bear
all the suffering that is entailed upon them by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
a known irregularity in their lives. She is
not. It would probably have killed her
though I am not saying that she would not
have been happy sometimes, when she could
forget her shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean flinched as though his brother had
struck him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what else would it be? What else
would the world call it? And women listen
to what the world says. &lsquo;Good name in man
or woman is the immediate jewel of their
souls&rsquo;; Othello said something like that,
and it&rsquo;s often true. Besides, you know, this
woman is pure in herself, and from what she
told me I understand that she has seen something
of the seamy side of love lately&mdash;enough
to inspire her with dread. She is afraid, and
her fear is exquisite; a very fine and rare thing.
It is the bloom on the fruit and should not
be brushed off with an ungentle hand. Poor
child! Don&rsquo;t blame her as she blames herself
or I shall begin to think she is too good for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean sat leaning forward staring into the
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you realise that when I brought her
here it was from starvation in a garret?
Where is she going? What will she do?
Oh, God! The poor little slender body! Do
you remember she said it was happiness just
to be warm and have enough to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Hilaire said hastily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
&ldquo;She is going to a good woman, a friend she
made in Siena. The letter you brought was
from her, and she wrote to say she had been ill
and wished Olive could come and be with her
for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see! And she was glad to get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear man, did you really think she
would be so easily won? She loves you, and
you not only made love to her yesterday
afternoon; you played to her&mdash;I heard you&mdash;and
I knew she would have to say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; to
everything. Now she says &lsquo;No,&rsquo; but you
must not think she does not care.&rdquo; Hilaire
got up, came across to where his brother sat,
and laid a caressing hand on his shoulder.
&ldquo;Dear Jean, will it comfort you to hear me
swear she means every word of that letter?
It&rsquo;s not all over. You will come together
in the end. Her poor blue eyes were drowned
in tears&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jean said brokenly. The
hard line of his lips relaxed. He hid his face
in his hands.</p>

<p>Hilaire went out of the room.</p>

<h2 class="padtop">BOOK III.&mdash;ROME</h2>



<h3 class="padtop">CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>Olive was alone in the compartment of the
train that bore her away from Florence and
from Jean. She had a book; it lay open on her
lap, and she had tried to read, but the lines all
ran together and the effort to concentrate her
thoughts made her head ache. She was very
unhappy. It seemed to her that now indeed
life was emptied of all sweets and the taste
of it was as dust and ashes in her mouth.
She was leaving youth and joy behind; or
rather, she had killed them and left a man to
bury them. At Orvieto she nearly broke
down. It would be so easy to get out and
cross over to the other platform and there
await the next train back to Florence. She
had her hand upon the handle of the door
when a boy with little flasks of wine in a
basket came up and asked her to buy, and as
she answered him she heard the cry of &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Partenza!</em>&rdquo;
It was too late; the moment had
passed, and after a while she knew that she
was glad she had not yielded. She was doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the right thing. What was the old French
motto? &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fais ce que doit, advienne que pourra.</i>&rdquo;
The brave words comforted her a little. She
was very tired, and presently she slept.</p>

<p>She was awakened by the discordant yells
of the Roman <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">facchini</i> on the station platform.
One of them carried her box to the office of
the Dogana, but a large party of Americans
had come by the same train and the officials
were too busily engaged in turning over the
contents of their innumerable Saratogas to do
more than scrabble in chalk on the side of her
shabby leather trunk and shake their heads at
the proffered key, and soon she was in a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vettura</i>
clattering down the wide new Via Nazionale.</p>

<p>Signora de Sanctis lived with her sister in
one of the old streets in the lower part of the
city near the Pantheon&mdash;the Via Arco della
Ciambella. The houses there are built on the
foundations of the Baths of Agrippa, and a
brick arch, part of the great Tepidarium, remains
to give the street its name. The poor
fragment has been Christianised; a wayside
altar sanctifies it, and a little painted shrine to
the Madonna adorns the base. The buildings
on that side are small and mean and overshadowed
by the great yellow palace of the
Spinola opposite. Olive&rsquo;s friends lived over
a wine shop, but the entrance was some way
down the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortunately, my dear,&rdquo; as they remarked,
&ldquo;though really the place is very quiet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
People go outside the gates to get
drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the women seemed glad to see her.
Her room was ready and a meal had been prepared
and the cloth laid at one end of the
work-table. The younger sister was a dressmaker
too, and the floor was strewn with
scraps of lining and silk. A white dress lay on
the sofa, carefully folded and covered with a
sheet of tissue paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look tired, Olive. Were you not
happy in Florence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl admitted that the Lorenzoni had
not been very kind to her. She had left them
and had been living on her savings. It had
been hard to find other employment. &ldquo;I want
to work,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will let me help
you, and I hope to get lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She asked to be allowed to wash the plates
and dishes and put them away in the tiny
kitchen. She was in a mood to bear anything
better than the idleness that left room for
her own sad thoughts, and she wished that
they would let her do some sewing. &ldquo;I am
not good at needlework, but I can hem and
put on buttons,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>

<p>Signora Giulia smiled at her. She was
small, and she had a pale, dragged look and
many lines about her weak eyes. &ldquo;No,
thank you, my dear. I have a girl apprentice
who comes during the day, and I do the cutting
out and designing and the embroidery myself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
You must not tire yourself in the kitchen
either. We have an old woman in to do
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mezzo servizio</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was nine o&rsquo;clock, and the narrow streets
were echoing now to the hoarse cries of the
newsvendors: &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tribuna!</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tribuna!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and unpack then, and to-morrow
I shall find some registry offices and try to
get English lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, go, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">nina</i>, and sleep well. You look
tired. You must get stronger while you are
with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long time she could not sleep. In the
summer she had played with the thought of
love, and then she had been able to close her
eyes and feel Jean Avenel close beside her,
leaning towards her, saying that she must not
be afraid, that he would not hurt her. It had
been a sort of game, a childish game of make-believe
that seemed to hurt no one, not even
herself. But now she was hurt indeed;
the remembrance of his kisses ached upon her
lips.</p>

<p>When Tor di Rocca had asked her to go
away with him she had felt that it might be
worth while, that it would be pleasant to be
cared for and loved, to eat and drink and
die on the morrow, but the man himself had
been nothing to her. A means to an
end.</p>

<p>She had been wholly a creature of blind
instincts, the will to live, to creep out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
dark into the sunshine that is inherent in the
animal, fighting against that other impulse,
trying to root up that white fragile flower,
watered throughout the centuries with blood
and tears and rare and precious ointment,
that thorn in some women&rsquo;s hearts, their
pale ideal of inviolate purity.</p>

<p>The spirit had warred against the flesh, and
the spirit had won then and now. It had
won, but not finally. She was dismayed to
find that temptation was a recurrent thing.
Every morning when she woke it returned to
her. It would be so easy to write &ldquo;Dearest,
come to me.&rdquo; It would be so easy to make
him happy. She thought little of herself now
and much of Jean. Would he stay on with
his brother or go away again? Had she hurt
him very much? Would he forget her? Or
hate her?</p>

<p>During the day she trudged the streets of
Rome and grew to know them well. Here,
as in Florence, no one wanted to pay for
learning, no one wanted an English girl for
anything apparently. If she had been Swiss,
and so able to speak three languages incorrectly,
she might have found a place as
nursery-governess; as it was, the people in
the registry offices grew tired of her and she
was afraid to go to them too often.</p>

<p>There was little for her to do in the house.
The old woman who came in did the cleaning,
and they lived on bread and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ricotta</i> cheese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and a cabbage soup that was easily prepared,
but sometimes she was able to help
with the sewing, and now and then she
was allowed to take the finished work
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not fit! They will take you for an
apprentice, a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sartina</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive laughed rather mirthlessly at that.
&ldquo;I am not proud,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sat up until two last night to finish the
Contessa&rsquo;s dress. She is always in a hurry.
If only she would pay what she owes,&rdquo; sighed
the dressmaker.</p>

<p>Olive promised to bring the money back with
her, and she waited a long while in the stuffy
passage of the Contessa&rsquo;s flat. There were
imitation Abyssinian trophies on the walls,
lances and daggers and shields of lathe and
cardboard and painted paper. The husband
was an artillery captain, and his sword stood
with the umbrellas in the rack, the only real
thing in that pretentious armoury.</p>

<p>The Contessa came out to her presently.
She was a large woman, and as she was angry
she seemed to swell and redden and gobble as
turkeys do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">giovinetta</i>? You will take
this dress away. It is not fit to put on.&rdquo;
She held the bodice in her hand, and as she
spoke she shook it in Olive&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;The
stitches are all awry; they are enormous;
and half the embroidery is blue and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
half green. I shall make her pay for the
material. The dress is ruined, and it is the
last she shall make for me. She must pay me,
and you must tell her so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive collected her scattered wits. &ldquo;If
the Signora Contessa would allow me to look,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>The stitches were very large, and her heart
sank as she examined them. The poor women
had toiled so over this work, stooping over it,
straining their tired eyes. &ldquo;I think we can
alter it to your satisfaction, but I must ask
you to be indulgent, signora. I will bring it
back the day after to-morrow, if that will suit
you.&rdquo; She folded the bodice carefully and
wrapped it in the piece of paper she had
brought it in, fastening the four corners with
pins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The skirt goes well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will do,&rdquo; the Contessa admitted as she
turned away. &ldquo;Anacleto!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A slender, dark-eyed youth emerged from
the shadows at the far end of the passage,
bringing a sound and smell of frying with him.
His bare brown arms were floury and he wiped
them on his striped cotton apron as he came
forward to open the door. He wore a white
camellia thrust behind one ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be convenient&mdash;Signora Manara
would be glad if you could pay part of her
account,&rdquo; faltered Olive.</p>

<p>The Contessa stopped short. &ldquo;I could,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
but I will not,&rdquo; she said emphatically. &ldquo;She
does her work too badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young servant grinned at the girl as
she passed out. She was half-way down the
stairs when he came out on to the landing and
leaned over the banisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never! Never!&rdquo; he called down to her.
&ldquo;They never pay anyone. I am leaving
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The white camellia dropped at her feet.
She smiled involuntarily as she stooped to
gather up the token. &ldquo;Men are rather
dears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She met Ser Giulia coming down the stairs
of their house. The little woman looked
quickly at the bundle she carried as she asked
why it had been brought back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wants it altered! <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio mio!</em> And
I worked so hard at it. How much of the
money has she given you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has given nothing; I hope she will
pay when I take the work back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the other began to cry. &ldquo;Perhaps the
stitches are large,&rdquo; she said, sobbing. &ldquo;I
know my eyes are weak. No one will pay
me, and I owe the baker more than ten lire.
Soon we shall have to beg our bread in the
streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Olive said hurriedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.
I have been with you more than a month and
I have not found work yet, but I will not be
a burden to you much longer. I shall find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
something to do soon and then you need not
do so much and we shall manage better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, child, I know you do your best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry then. I will get money somehow.
Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>Olive sat idly on one of the benches near the
great wall in the Pincian gardens. She had
been to an office in the Piazza di Spagna and
had there been assured for the seventh time
that there was nothing on the books. &ldquo;If
the signorina were a cook now, there are many
people in need of cooks,&rdquo; the young man
behind the counter had said smilingly, and
she had thanked him and come away. What
else could she do?</p>

<p>It was getting late, and a fading light
filtered through the bare interwoven branches
of the planes. The shadows were lengthening
in the avenues and grass-bordered paths where
the seminarists had been walking in twos and
threes among the playing children. They
were gone now, the grave-faced young men in
their black soutanes and broad beaver hats;
all the people were gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Pasquina! <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Birichina!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive, turning her head, saw a young
woman and a child coming towards her. The
little thing was clinging to its mother&rsquo;s skirts,
stumbling at every step, whining to be taken
up, and now she dropped the white rabbit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
muff and the doll she was carrying into a
puddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Pasquina!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child stared open-mouthed as Olive
came forward and stooped to pick up the
fallen treasures, and though tears were running
down her little face she made no outcry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, the beautiful lady helps you,&rdquo; the
mother said hastily, and she sat down on the
bench at Olive&rsquo;s side and lifted the baby on
to her lap to comfort her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is tired. We have been to the Campo
Marzo to buy her a fine hat with white
feathers,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>Olive looked at her with interest. She was
not at all pretty; her round snubby face was
red and she had a bruise on her chin, and yet
she was somehow attractive. Her small,
twinkling blue eyes were so kind, and her
hair was beautiful, smooth, shining, and
yellow as straw. She wore no hat.</p>

<p>Her name was Rosina. The signorino was
always very good, and he gave her an afternoon
off when she asked for it. On Christmas
night, for instance, she had drunk too much
wine, and she had fallen down in the street
and hurt herself. The next day her head
ached so, and when the signorino saw she
was not well he said she might go home and
sleep. She had been working for him six
weeks. What work? She seemed surprised
at the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am a model. My face is ugly, as you
see,&rdquo; she said in her simple, straightforward
way; &ldquo;but otherwise I am beautiful, and I
can always get work with sculptors. The
signorino is an American and he has an unpronounceable
name. He is doing me as Eve,
crouched on the ground and hiding my head
in my arms. After the Fall, you know. Have
you been to the Andreoni gallery? There is a
statuette of me there called &lsquo;Morning.&rsquo; This
is the pose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clasped her hands together behind her
head, raising her chin a little. Olive observed
the smooth long throat, the exquisite lines of
the shoulders and breast and hips. Pasquina
slipped off her mother&rsquo;s knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well paid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It depends on the artist. Some are so
poor that they cannot give, and others will
not. The schools allow fifteen soldi an hour,
but the signorino is paying me twenty-five
soldi. In the evenings I sing and dance
at a <i>caff&egrave;</i> near the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive hesitated. &ldquo;Do&mdash;do artists ever
want models dressed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosina looked at her quickly. &ldquo;Oh, yes,
when they are as pretty as you are. But you
are well educated&mdash;one sees that&mdash;it is not
fit work for such as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; Olive said eagerly.
&ldquo;How does one begin being a model? I will
try that. Will you help me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Rosina beamed at her. &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sicuro!</em> We
will go to Varini&rsquo;s school in the Corso if you
like. The woman in the newspaper kiosk
in the Piazza di Spagna knows me, and I can
leave Pasquina with her. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">An&rsquo;iamo!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two girls went together down the wide,
shallow steps of the Trinit&agrave; dei Monti with the
child between them.</p>

<p>Poor little Pasquina was the outward and
visible sign of her mother&rsquo;s inward and hopelessly
material gracelessness; she symbolised
the great gulf fixed between smirched Roman
Rosina and Jean&rsquo;s English rose in their
different understanding of their own hearts&rsquo;
uses. Olive believed love to be the way
to heaven; Rosina knew it, or thought she
knew it, as a means of livelihood.</p>

<p>The model was very evidently not only
familiar with the studios. The cabmen on the
rank in the piazza hailed her with cries of
&ldquo;Rosi&rdquo;; she was greeted by beggars at the
street corners, dustmen, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri</i>, crossing-sweepers,
and Olive was not wholly unembarrassed.
Yet Rosina escaped the vulgarity
of some who might be called her betters as the
world goes by being simply natural. When
she was amused she laughed aloud, when she
was tired she yawned as openly and flagrantly
as any duchess. In manners extremes meet,
and the giggle and the sneer are the disastrous
half measures of the ill-bred, the social
greasers. Rosina had never been sly in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
life; she was ever as simply without shame as
Eve before the Fall, and lawless because she
knew no law. The darkness of Northern
cities is tainted and cold and cannot bring
forth such kindly things as the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">rosine</i>&mdash;little
roses&mdash;that spring up in the warm, sweet
Roman dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is Varini&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed through a covered passage into a
little garden overgrown with laurels and gnarled
old pepper trees; there was a fountain with
gold fish, and green arums were springing up
about a broken faun&rsquo;s head set on a pedestal
of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">verd&rsquo; antico</i>. Some men were standing
together in the path, a pretty dark-eyed
peasant girl with them. They all turned to
stare, and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cioccara</i> put out her tongue
as Olive went by. Rosina instantly replied
in kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Oh&egrave;! Fortunata! Benedetta ragazza!</em>
Resting as usual? Does Lorenz still beat
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She described the antecedents and characteristics
of Lorenz.</p>

<p>The slower-witted country girl had a more
limited vocabulary. Her eyes glared in the
shadow of her white coif. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Brutta bestia!</em>&rdquo; and she turned her back.</p>

<p>The men laughed, and Rosina laughed with
them as she knocked on a green painted door
in the wall. It was opened by a burly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
bearded man, tweed-clad, and swathed in a
stained painting apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Professore</i>, here is a friend of mine
who wants work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said shortly, and they followed
him into a large untidy studio. A
Pompeian fruit-seller in a black frame, a study
for a Judgment of Paris on a draped easel,
and on another easel the portrait of an old
lady just begun. There were stacks of canvases
on the floor and on all the chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn to the light,&rdquo; the artist said
brusquely; and then, as Olive obeyed him,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened. You are new, I see.
You are so pink and white that I thought you
were painted. You are not Italian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>He smiled. &ldquo;Ah, well, it does not matter.
You can come to the pavilion on Monday at
five and sit to the evening class for a week.
You understand? Wait a minute.&rdquo; He
went to the door and called one of the young
men in from the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a new model, Mario. I have
engaged her for the evening class. What do
you think of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carina assai</i>,&rdquo; approved Mario. He was
a round-faced, snub-nosed youth with clever
brown eyes set very far apart, and a humorous
mouth. &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carina assai!</em>&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
&ldquo;Fifteen soldi the hour, from five to seven-thirty,&rdquo;
said the professor. &ldquo;Come a little
before the time on Monday; the porter will
show you what costume you must wear and I
shall be there to pose you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I shall take you to M&rsquo;sieur Michelin,&rdquo;
Rosina said when they had left Varini&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;He is looking for a type, and perhaps you
will please him. He is <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">strano</i>, but good
always, and he pays well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not tiring you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ma che!</em> I must see that you begin well
and with the right people. Some painters are
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">canaglia</i>. Ah, I know that,&rdquo; the girl said
with a little sigh and a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>They went by way of the Via Babuino
across the Piazza di Spagna, and up the little
hill past the convent of English nuns to the
Villa Medici. Rosina rang the gate-bell, and
the old braided Cerberus admitted them
grumblingly. &ldquo;You are late. But if it is
M&rsquo;sieur Camille&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Camille Michelin, bright particular star of
the French Prix de Rome constellation, lived
and worked in one of the more secluded garden-studios
of the villa; it was deep set in the ilex
wood, and the girls came to it by a narrow
winding path, box-edged, and strewn with
dead leaves. A light shone in one of the upper
windows; the great man was there and he
came down the creaking wooden stairs himself
to open the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who is it? Rosina? I have put away
the Anthony canvas for a month and I will
let you know when I want you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, signorino, I have brought you a
type.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said eagerly, in his execrable
Italian. &ldquo;Fresh, sweet, clean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sicuro.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe you. You are lying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Camille was picturesque from the crown of
his flaxen head to the soles of his brown boots;
his pallor was interesting, his blue eyes remarkable;
he habitually wore rust-coloured
velveteen; he smoked cigarettes incessantly.
All men who knew and loved his work saw in
him a decadent creature of extraordinary
charm; and yet, in spite of his &ldquo;Aholibah,&rdquo; his
&ldquo;Salome,&rdquo; and his horribly beautiful, unfinished
study of Fulvia piercing the tongue
of Cicero, in spite of his Byron-cum-Baudelaire
after Velasquez and Vandyke exterior
he always managed to be quite boyishly simple
and sincere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; Then, as his eyes met
Olive&rsquo;s, he cried, &ldquo;Not you, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
His surprise was as manifest as his pleasure.
&ldquo;My friends have sworn that I could never
paint a wholesome picture. Now I will show
them. When can you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not fail me,&rdquo; he implored. &ldquo;Such
harpies have been here to show themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to me; fat, brown, loose-lipped things with
purple-shadowed eyes. But you are perfect;
divine bread-and-butter. They think they
are clean because they have washed in soap
and water, but it is the stainless soul I want.
It must shine through my canvas as it does
through Angelico&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall please you,&rdquo; faltered the
girl. &ldquo;I&mdash;I only pose draped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her quickly. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I will remember. It is your head
I want. You are not Roman; have you sat
to any other man here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I am going to Varini&rsquo;s in the evenings
next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Well, don&rsquo;t let anyone else get
hold of you. Gontrand will be trying to snap
you up. He is so tired of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cioccare</i>. What
shall I call you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I have no name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall give you one. You shall be called
child. Come at nine and you will find the
door open.&rdquo; He fumbled in his pockets for
some silver. &ldquo;Here, Rosina, this is for the
little one.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>The virtue that bruises not only the heel of
the Evil One but the heart of the beloved is
never its own reward. The thought of Jean&rsquo;s
aching loneliness oppressed Olive far more than
her own. She believed that she had done
right in leaving him, but no consciousness of
her own rectitude sustained her, and she was
pitifully far from any sense of self-satisfaction.
Her head hung dejectedly in the cold light
of its aureole. Sometimes she hated herself
for being one of the dull ninety-and-nine who
never stray and who need no forgiveness,
and yet she clung to her dear ideal of love
thorn-crowned, white, and clean.</p>

<p>She had hoped to be able to help her
friends, but that hope had faded, and she had
been very near despair. There was something
pathetic now in her intense joy at the
thought of earning a few pence. She lied to
the kind women at home because she knew
they would not understand. They might
believe the way to the Villa Medici to be the
primrose path that leads to everlasting fire&mdash;they
probably would if they had ever heard of
Camille. She told them she had found
lessons, and the wolf seemed to skulk growlingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
away from the door as she uttered the
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid of the baker now,&rdquo;
she told Ser Giulia. &ldquo;He shall be paid at the
end of the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her waking on the Monday morning was
the happiest she had known since she left
Florence. She was to help to make beautiful
things. Her part would be passive; but
they also serve who only stand and wait.
She was not of those who see degradation in
the lesser forms of labour. Each worker is
needed to make the perfect whole. The men
who wrought the gold knots and knops of the
sanctuary, who wove the veil for the Holy
of Holies, were called great, but the hewers
of wood and carriers of water were temple
builders too, even though their part was but
to raise up scaffoldings that must come down
again, or to mix the mortar that is unseen
though it should weld the whole. Men might
pass these toilers by in silence, but God would
surely praise them.</p>

<p>Praxiteles moulded a goddess in clay, and
we still acclaim him after the lapse of some two
thousand years. What of the woman who
wearied and ached that his eyes might not
fail to learn the least sweet curve of her?
What of the patient craftsmen who hewed out
the block of marble, whose eyes were inflamed,
whose lungs were scarred by the white dust
of it? They suffered for beauty&rsquo;s sake&mdash;not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
as some might say, because they must eat
and live. Even slaves might get bread by
easier ways. But, very simply for beauty&rsquo;s
sake.</p>

<p>Olive might have soon learnt how vile such
service may be in the studios of any of the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">canaglia</i> poor Rosina knew, but Camille, that
sheep in wolf&rsquo;s clothing, was safe enough.
What there was in him of perversity, of brute
force, he expended in the portrayal of his
subtly beautiful furies. His art was feverishly
decadent, and those who judge a man by his
work might suppose him to be a monster of
iniquity. He was, in fact, an extremely
clever and rather worldly-wise boy who loved
violets and stone-pines and moonlight with
poetical fervour, who preferred milk to champagne,
and saunterings in green fields to
gambling on green cloth.</p>

<p>That February morning was cloudless, and
Rome on her seven hills was flooded in sunshine.
The birds were singing in the ilex
wood as Olive passed through, and Camille
was singing too in his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">atelier</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Derri&egrave;re chez mon p&egrave;re</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la rose.</i>&rsquo;<br /></span>

<span class="i1"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la rose et le lilas!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you would be late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, smiling, as she came to
him across the great room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women always are. But you are not a
woman; you are an angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her closely. The strong north
light showed her smooth skin flawless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The white and rose is charming,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And I adore freckles. But your eyes are too
deep; one can see that you have suffered.
There is too much in them for the innocent
baa-lamb picture I must paint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face fell. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear child, you will,&rdquo; he reassured her.
&ldquo;I shall paint your lashes and not your eyes.
Your lashes and a curve of pink cheek. Now
go behind that screen and put on the sprigged
cotton frock you will find there, with a muslin
fichu and a mob cap. I have a basket of
wools here and a piece of tapestry. The sort
of woman I have never painted is always doing
needlework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Camille spent half the morning in the
arrangement of the accessories that were, as
he said, to suggest virtuous domesticity; then
he settled the folds of the girl&rsquo;s skirt, the turn
of her head, her hands. At last, when he was
satisfied, he went to his easel and began to
work. Olive had never before realised how
hard it is to keep quite still. The muscles
of her neck ached and her face seemed to grow
stiff and set; she felt her hands quivering.</p>

<p>Hours seemed to pass before his voice broke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the silence. &ldquo;I have drawn it in,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;You can rest now. Come down
and see some of my pictures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He showed her his &ldquo;Salome,&rdquo; a Hebrew
m&aelig;nad, whose scarlet, parted lips ached for
the desert dreamer&rsquo;s death; &ldquo;Lucrezia Borgia,&rdquo;
slow-smiling, crowned with golden hair; and
a rough charcoal study for Queen Eleanor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to see you as Henry&rsquo;s Rosamund,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;the haunting shadow of
coming sorrow in blue eyes. You have
suffered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. &ldquo;Forgive me!
It is past noon. Run away, child, and come
back at two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The day seemed very long in spite of
Camille&rsquo;s easy kindness, and the girl shrank
from the subsequent sitting at Varini&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you pose for those wretched
boys?&rdquo; grumbled the Prix de Rome man.
&ldquo;After this week you must come to me only.
I must paint a Rosamund.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At sunset she hurried down the hill to the
Corso, and came by way of the corridor and
garden to the pavilion. The porter took her
into a dingy little lumber-filled passage and
left her there. A soiled pink satin frock was
laid ready for her on a broken chair. As she
put it on she heard a babel of voices in the
class-room beyond, and she felt something
like stage-fright as she fumbled at the hooks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and eyes; but a clock struck the hour presently,
and she went in then and climbed on to
the throne. At first she saw nothing, but after
a while she was aware of a group of men who
stood near the door regarding her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carina.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a fine colour, but too thin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the professor came in he made her sit
in a carved chair, and gave her a fan to hold.
The men moved about, choosing their
places, and were silent until he left them with
a gruff &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Felice notte</i>.&rdquo; Olive noticed the lad
who had been called in to Varini&rsquo;s studio to
see her; the boy who sat next him had a round,
impudent face, and when presently she yawned
he smiled at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will ask questions to keep you awake,
but you must answer truly. Have you taken
a fancy to anyone here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dislike you or Mario.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rose simultaneously and bowed. &ldquo;We
are honoured. But why? Bembi here is
a fine figure of a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; growled Bembi. &ldquo;You talk
too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the rest Olive went to look at the
boys&rsquo; work; it was brilliantly impressionistic.
The younger had evidently founded himself on
Mario, and Mario was, perhaps, a genius.</p>

<p>They came and sat down, one on either side
of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you pretending to be a model?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
whispered Mario. &ldquo;We can see you are not.
Are you hiding from someone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;I am earning my
bread,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Be kind to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will.&rdquo; He patted her bare shoulder
with the air of a grandfather, but his brown
eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are some of the men so old, and
why is some of the work so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad.&rdquo; Mario squinted at Bembi&rsquo;s black,
smudged drawing. &ldquo;I will tell you. That
bald man in the corner is seventy-two;
painting is his amusement, and he loves
models. He wants to marry Fortunata, but
she won&rsquo;t have him because he is toothless.
Once, twenty-five years ago, he sold a watercolour
for ten lire and he has never forgotten
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really because he is toothless?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is mad too, and she is afraid of
him. Cesare and I are the only ones here
who will make you look human. It is a pity,
as you are really <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carina</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He patted her shoulder again and pinched
her ear, and Cesare passed his arm about her
waist. She struggled to free herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; cried the other men, and,
flushed and dishevelled, she took refuge on the
throne. The pose was resumed, and the room
settled down to work again.</p>

<p>She kept very still, but after a while the
tears that filled her eyes overflowed, ran down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
her cheeks, and dripped upon the hand that
held the fan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; cried Mario.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mascalzone</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive them for our sakes,&rdquo; growled
Bembi, &ldquo;or they will cackle all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive laughed a little in spite of herself,
but she was very tired and they had hurt her.
The marks of Cesare&rsquo;s fingers showed red still
on her wrist, and the lace of the short sleeve
was torn.</p>

<p>Mario clattered out of the room presently,
and came back with a glass of water for her.
&ldquo;I am really sorry,&rdquo; he whispered as he gave
it. &ldquo;Do stop crying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all they had not meant any harm.
She was a little comforted, and the expressed
contrition helped her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be better soon,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>

<p>When she got home to the apartment in Via
Arco della Ciambella there were lies to be told
about the lessons, the pupils, the hours.
The fine edge of her exaltation was already
blunted, and she sighed at the thought of her
morning dreams; sighed and was glad; the
first steps had not cost much after all, and
she had earned five lire and fifteen soldi.</p>

<p>The lamp was lit in the little sitting-room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and Ser Giulia was there, cutting out a skirt
on the table very carefully, in a tense silence
that was broken only by the click of the
scissors and the rustle of silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have lost confidence in myself,&rdquo; she said
as she fastened the shining lengths together
with pins. &ldquo;This <em>is</em> the right side of the
material, isn&rsquo;t it, my dear? I can&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is right. Let me stitch the seams
for you. Where is Signora Aurelia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has gone to bed. Her head ached.
She&mdash;she does not complain, but I think
she needs more sun and air than she can get
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive looked at her quickly. &ldquo;You ought
to go away and rest, both of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our brother in Como would be glad to
have us with him, but it is impossible at
present. I paid our rent a few days ago&mdash;three
months in advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go to the house-agent in the Piazza
di Spagna to-morrow. It should not be
difficult to get a tenant, and at the end of the
time the furniture could be warehoused, or
you could sell it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ser Giulia hesitated. &ldquo;What would you
do then, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">figliuola mia</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can take care of myself,&rdquo; the girl said
easily.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p>After the first week Olive went only to
Camille&rsquo;s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">atelier</i>. He was working hard at
his &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;tude blanche</i>,&rdquo; but no one had been
allowed to see it, except, of course, M&rsquo;sieur
le Directeur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost wish I had asked you to come
always heavily veiled. The other men are
all mad about you, and Gontrand tells me he
wants you to give him sittings for the head
of an oread, but he cannot have you. You
are mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a lean, black-bearded man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He spoke to me the other day as I was
coming through the garden, and asked me if
you were really painting a &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune fille</i>&rsquo;
picture. I said you were painting a picture,
and he would probably see it when you had
your show in April.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Camille laughed. &ldquo;Good child! We must
keep up the mystery.&rdquo; He flung down his
brushes. &ldquo;I cannot work any more to-day.
Will you come with me for a drive into the
Campagna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated. &ldquo;I am not sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come as my little brother.&rdquo; He took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
off his linen painting sleeves, and began to
dabble his fingers in a pan of turpentine.
&ldquo;My little brother! Do you know that the
Directeur thinks you are charming, and he
wonders that I do not love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you do not,&rdquo; she said, colouring.
&ldquo;If you did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was lighting a cigarette. &ldquo;If I did?&rdquo;
The little momentary flame of the match was
reflected in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should go away and not come back
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do not,&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;I care
for you as St Francis did for his pet sparrow.
So now put your hat on and I will go down
and get a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vettura</i> with a good horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a creature of moods, and so young
in many ways that he appealed to the girl as
Astorre had done, by the queer, pathetic little
flaws in his manhood. Some days he worked
incessantly from early morning until the
light failed at his picture, but there were
times when he seemed unable even to look at
it. He made several studies in charcoal for
&ldquo;Rosamund.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an inspiration,&rdquo; he said excitedly
more than once. &ldquo;The rose of the world
that can only be reached by love&mdash;or hate&mdash;holding
the clue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had promised an American who had
bought a picture of his the year before that he
would do some work for him in Venice in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
spring. &ldquo;Very rash of me,&rdquo; he said fractiously.
&ldquo;The &lsquo;Jeune Fille&rsquo; would have been
quite enough for me to show, and it is dreadful
to have to leave it unfinished now.&rdquo; And
when Gontrand tried to persuade him to let
him have Olive during his absence he was,
as the girl phrased it, quite cross. &ldquo;I have
seen enough of that. Last year in the Salon
St Elizabeth of Hungary, and Clytemnestra,
and Malesherbe&rsquo;s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vivandi&egrave;re</i> were one and the
same woman. Besides, oreads are nearly
related to Bacchantes, Gontrand, and I am
not going to allow my little sewing-girl to
be mixed up with people of that sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made Olive promise not to sit for any
of the other men at the Villa Medici.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall work at Varini&rsquo;s in the evenings,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;And one of the men there wants
me to come to his studio in the Via Margutta
three mornings a week. He is a Baron von
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Frenchman&rsquo;s face lightened. &ldquo;Oh,
that German! I know him. I saw a landscape
of his once. It looked as if several
tubes of paint had got together and burst.
What else will you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rome, if you will lend me your B&aelig;deker,&rdquo;
she answered. &ldquo;I shall begin with A and work
my way through Beatrice Cenci and the
Borgo Nuovo to the Corsini Gallery and the
Corso. Some of the letters may be rather
dull. I am so glad Apollo comes now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
He laughed. &ldquo;M for Michelin. You will
be sure to admire me when my turn comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive was living alone now in a tall old house
in Ripetta. The two kind women who had
been her friends had left Rome and gone to
stay with their brother at Como. It was
evidently the best thing they could do, and
the girl had assured them that she was quite
well able to look after herself, but they had
been only half convinced by her reasoning.
She was English and she had done it before.
&ldquo;That is nothing,&rdquo; Ser Giulia said. &ldquo;You
may catch a ball once, and the second time
it may slip through your fingers. And sometimes
Life is like the importunate widow
and goes on asking until one gives what one
should not.&rdquo; She helped her to find a room,
and eked out the furniture from her own
little store. &ldquo;Another saucepan, and a
kettle, and a blanket. And if lessons fail
you must come to us, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">figliuola mia</i>. My
brother&rsquo;s house is large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl had answered her with a kiss, but
though she loved them she was not altogether
sorry to see them go. She could never tell
them how she had earned the lire that paid
the baker&rsquo;s bill. The truth would hurt them,
and she would not give them a moment&rsquo;s pain
if she could avoid it, but she was not good at
lying. Even the very little white ones stuck
in her throat, and she was relieved to be no
longer under the necessity of uttering them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
The room she had taken was on the sixth
floor, and from the one narrow window she
could look across the yellow swirl of Tiber
towards Monte Mario. She had set up her
household gods. The plaster bust of Dante,
and her books, on the rickety wooden table
by her bedside, and, such as it was, this place
was home.</p>

<p>Camille went by a night train, and Olive
began to &ldquo;see Rome&rdquo; on the following morning.
She took the tram to the Piazza Venezia
and walked from thence to the church of
Santa Maria Ara Coeli.</p>

<p>The flight of steps to the west door is very
long, and she climbed slowly, stopping once
or twice to take breath and look back at the
crowded roofs and many church domes of
Rome, and at the green heights of the Janiculan
hill beyond, with the bronze figure of
Garibaldi on his horse, dominant, and very
clear against the sky.</p>

<p>The cripple at the door lifted the heavy
leather curtain for her and she put a soldo into
his outstretched hand as she went in. The
church seemed very still, very quiet, after
the clamour of the streets. The acrid scent
of incense was as the breath of spent prayer.
Little yellow flames flickered in the shrine
lamps before each altar, but it was early yet
and for the moment no mass was being said.
An old, white-haired monk was sweeping
the worn pavement. He was swathed in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
blue linen apron, and his rusty brown frock
was tucked up about his ankles. A lean
black cat followed him, mewing, and now and
then he stopped his work to stroke it. There
was a great stack of chairs by the door, and a
few were scattered about the aisles and
occupied by stray worshippers, women with
handkerchiefs tied over their heads in deference
to St Paul&rsquo;s expressed wishes, two or
three old men, and some peasants with
their market baskets. A be-ribboned nurse
carrying a baby had just come in to see the
Sacro Bambino, and Olive followed them
into the sacristy and saw the child laid down
before the bedizened, red-cheeked wooden
doll in the glass case. As they passed out
again the monk who was in attendance gave
Olive a coloured card with a prayer printed
on the back. She heard him asking what was
the matter with the little one. The woman
lifted the lace veil from the tiny face and
showed him the sightless eyes. He crossed
himself. &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Poveretto! Dio vi benedica!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Olive left the sacristy a tall man came
across the aisle towards her. It was Prince
Tor di Rocca.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a great pleasure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
not to you, I am afraid. You are not glad to
see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am surprised. I&mdash;do you often come
into churches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;I sometimes follow women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in. I saw you coming up the steps just now.
You are right in supposing that I am not
devout. I want to speak to you. Shall we
go out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked for a way of escape but saw none.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;very well,&rdquo; she said rather helplessly.</p>

<p>The hunchback woman at the south door
watched them expectantly as they came
towards her, and she brightened as she saw
the man&rsquo;s hand go to his pocket. He threw
her a piece of silver as they passed out. He
was in a good humour, his fine lips smiling, a
glinting zest in his insolent eyes. He thought
he understood women, and he had in fact
made a one-sided study of the sex. He had
seen their ways of loving, he had listened to
the beating of their hearts; but of their
endurance, their long patience, their daily
life he knew nothing. He was like a man
who often wears a bunch of violets in his coat
until they fade, and yet has never seen, or
cared to see them, growing sparsely, small and
sweet, half hidden in leaves on a mossy bank
by the stream.</p>

<p>Women amused him. He was seldom
much moved by them, and he pursued them
without haste or flurry, treading delicately like
Agag of old. He had little intrigues everywhere,
in Florence, in Naples, in Rome.
Young married women, girls walking demurely
with their mothers. He liked to know that
it was he who brought the colour to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
cheeks and that their eyes sought him among
the crowd of men standing outside Aragno&rsquo;s
in the Corso or on the steps of the club in the
Via Tornabuoni. Very often the affair would
be one of the eyes only, but sometimes it went
farther. Filippo&rsquo;s procedure varied. Sometimes
he put advertisements in the personal
column of the Popolo Romano, and sometimes
he wrote notes. It was always very
interesting while it lasted. Occasionally affairs
overlapped, as when an appeal to F. to meet
Norina once more in the Borghese appeared
in print above F.&rsquo;s request that the signorina
in the pink hat would write to him at the Poste
Restante.</p>

<p>Olive had nearly yielded to him in Florence,
and then she had run away, she had sought
safety in flight. Evidently then his battle
had been nearly won. But she had reassembled
her forces, and he saw that it would
be all to fight over again, and that the issue
was doubtful.</p>

<p>As they came into the little square piazza
of the Capitol she turned to him. &ldquo;What
have you to say? I&mdash;I am in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for that, but if you are going
anywhere I can walk with you, or we can take
a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vettura</i> and drive together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked past him at the green shining
figure of Marcus Aurelius on his horse riding
between her and the sun, and said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall enjoy being with you even if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
are inclined to be silent. You are so good to
look at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His brazen stare gave point to his words.
Her face was no longer childish in its charm.
It had lost the first roundness of youth, but
had gained in expression. A soul seemed
to be shining through the veil of flesh&mdash;white
and rose-red flesh, divinely gilt with freckles&mdash;and
fluttering in the troubled depths of her
blue eyes. The nun-like simplicity of her
grey dress pleased him: it did not detract from
her; it left the eyes free to return to her face,
to dwell upon her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something has happened,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There is another man. Are you married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only came to Rome yesterday. Strange
that we should meet so soon. It seems that
there is a Destiny that shapes our ends after
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not believe in free will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I do not think
about such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said impatiently. &ldquo;Is that
all you have to say? I suppose the Marchesa
and Mamie are here too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated and seemed to lose some of
his assurance. &ldquo;No, we quarrelled. The
girl is insupportable. She is engaged now to
a lord of sorts, an Englishman, and they are
still in Cairo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have lost her too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
&ldquo;It was your fault that Edna gave
me up. You owe me something for that.
And you behaved badly to me again&mdash;afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed enjoyingly. &ldquo;I trusted you
and you took advantage of a truce to run
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She moved away from him, but he followed
her and kept at her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never asked you to trust me. I asked
you to come the next day for an answer.
You came and you had it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came and I had it,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Did
the old woman give you my message?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we should meet again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not all. I said you would come
to me one day sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had paused at the top of the steps
that lead down from the Capitol into the
streets and are guarded by the gigantic
figures of Castor and Pollux, great masses of
discoloured marble set on pedestals on either
side. It was twelve o&rsquo;clock, and a black
stream of hungry, desk-weary men poured
out of the Capitoline offices. Many turned
to look at the English girl as they hurried by,
and one passing close to her muttered &ldquo;bella&rdquo;
in her ear. She drew back as though she had
been stung. Filippo laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only ask to be let alone,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand that you remind me of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
things I want to forget. I am ashamed, oh,
can&rsquo;t you understand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left him and went to stand on the outskirts
of the crowd that had collected in front
of the cage in which the wolves are kept.
Evidently she hoped that he would go on,
but he meant to disappoint her, and when
she went down the steps he was close beside
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so unkind to me?&rdquo; he said,
and as they crossed the road he held her
arm.</p>

<p>She wrenched herself away, went up to the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabiniere</i>, who stood at the corner, and
spoke to him. The man smiled tolerantly as
he glanced from her to Filippo. &ldquo;Signorina,
I cannot help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She passed on down the street, knowing
that she was being followed, crossed the
Corso Vittorio Emanuele and took a tram in
the Piazza della Minerva. Tor di Rocca got
in too and sat down opposite to her. The conductor
turned to him first, and when she
proffered her four soldi she found that he
had paid for both. Her hand shook as she
put the money back in her purse, and her
colour rose. Filippo, quite at his ease,
leisurely, openly observant of her, whistled
&ldquo;Lucia&rdquo; softly to himself. Roses, roses all the
way, and all for him, he thought amusedly.
And yet she bore the ordeal well, betraying
no restlessness, keeping her eyes unswervingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
fixed on the two lions of the advertisement
of Chinina Migone pasted on the glass
over his head. At the Ripetta bridge she
got out. He followed, saw her go into a house
farther down the street, and paused on the
threshold to take the number before he went
up the stairs after her. She heard him
coming. He turned the handle of the door,
but she had locked it and it held fast. He
knocked once and called to her. Evidently
he was not sure of her being within. There
was another room on the same landing, and
after a while he tried that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you in there? <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carissima</i>, you are
wasting time. To-day or to-morrow, sooner or
later. Why not to-day, and soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silence ensued. The girl had taken off
her hat and thrown it down upon the table.
She stood very still in the middle of the room
listening, waiting for him to go away again.
Her breath came quickly, and little pearls of
sweat broke out upon her forehead. His
persistence frightened her.</p>

<p>He waited for an answer, and receiving none,
added, &ldquo;Well, I will come again,&rdquo; and so
went away.</p>

<p>She stayed in until it was time to go to
Varini&rsquo;s. It was not far, but she was flushed
and panting with the haste that she had made
as she put on the faded blue silk dress that
had been laid out ready for her on the one
broken chair in the dressing-room. Rosina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
came in to her presently from the professor&rsquo;s
studio. She wore a man&rsquo;s tweed coat and a
striped blanket wrapped about her, and she
was smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have come back to work here.
Your signorino at the Villa Medici is away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for a few days. He will not be gone
long. The picture is not finished. How is
Pasquina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosina had come over to her and was
fastening the hooks of her bodice. &ldquo;She is
very well. How pretty you are.&rdquo; She rearranged
the laces at the girl&rsquo;s breast and
caught up a torn piece of the silk with a pin.
&ldquo;That is better. Have you been running?
You seem hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rosina, I have been frightened. A
man followed me. I shall be afraid to go
home to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The yellow-haired Trasteverina looked at
her shrewdly. &ldquo;He knows where you live?
Have you only seen him once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he came and tried my door. I am
afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosina nodded. &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Si capisce!</em> I will take
care of you. I have met so many <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mascalzoni</i>
in twenty years that I have grown used to
them. I will come home with you, and if any
man so much as looks at us I will scratch his
eyes out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through the thin partition wall they heard
the professor calling for his model. &ldquo;I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
go,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, but as she passed
out Olive caught at a fold of the enveloping
blanket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, I want you.&rdquo; She flung her
arms about the other girl&rsquo;s neck and kissed
her. &ldquo;You are good! You are good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into the class room and climbed
the throne as the men came clattering in to
take their places. The professor posed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have come back to us. Do not
let them spoil you at the Villa Medici&mdash;your
head a little higher&mdash;so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first drawing in of the figure is not a
thing to be taken lightly, and the silence was
seldom broken at Varini&rsquo;s on Monday evenings.
The two boys, however, found it hard
to repress the natural loquacity of their
extreme youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Al lavoro</i>, Mario! What are you whispering
about? Cesare, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">zitto</i>!&rdquo; Bembi stared
at them. &ldquo;Their chins are disappearing,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;See their collars. Every day an
inch higher. <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio mio!</em> Is that the way to
please women? I wear a flannel shirt and
my neck is as bare as a plucked chicken, and
yet I&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped short.</p>

<p>Mario laughed. &ldquo;Women are strange,&rdquo;
he admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mad!&rdquo; cried Cesare, and then as Bembi
still smirked ineffably he appealed to Olive.
&ldquo;Do you admire fowls wrapped in flannel
or <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in arrosto</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
When she came out she found Rosina
waiting for her in the courtyard, a grey
shadow with smooth fair hair shining in the
moonlight. &ldquo;The professor let me go at
eight so I dressed and came out here,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;The dressing-room is full of
dust and spider&rsquo;s webs. I told the porter
the other day that he ought to sweep it, but
he only laughed at me and said Domeniddio
made spiders long before he took a rib out of
Adam&rsquo;s side to whip a naughty world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the man?&rdquo; she asked presently
as they walked along together. &ldquo;Do I know
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think so. He is not an artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosina laid a hand upon her arm. &ldquo;Is
that he?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>They had passed through one of the narrow
streets that lead from the Corso towards the
river and were come into the Ripetta.</p>

<p>A tall man was walking slowly along on the
other side of the road. He did not seem to
have noticed the two girls, and yet as he
stopped to light a cigarette he was looking
towards them. A tram came clanging up,
the overhead wires emitting strange noises
peculiar to themselves, the gong ringing
sharply. Olive glanced up at the red painted
triangle fixed to the lamp-post at the corner.
&ldquo;It will stop here. Quick! while it is
between us. Perhaps he has not seen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They ran to her door and up the stairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
together. &ldquo;It has only just gone on,&rdquo; cried
Rosina. &ldquo;Have you got your key?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stayed on the landing while Olive went
into the room and lit her candle. There was
no sound in the house at all, no step upon the
stair. As she peered down over the banisters
into the darkness below she listened intently.
The rustling of her skirt sounded loud in
the stillness, but there was nothing else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not see us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall
go now. Lock your door. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Felice notte,
piccina.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>


<p>Camille, loitering on the terrace of the old
garden of the Villa Medici, was quick to hear
the creaking of the iron gate upon its hinges.
His pale face brightened as he threw away his
cigarette and he went down the path between
the ilex trees to meet his model.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come. Oh, I seem to have been
years away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went up the hill together. It was
early yet, and the city was veiled in fine mist
through which the river gleamed here and
there with a sharpness of steel. The dome
of St Peter&rsquo;s was still dark against the greenish
pallor of the morning sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to be in Rome again. Venice
is beautiful, but it does not inspire me. It has
no associations for me. What do I care for the
Doges, or for Titian&rsquo;s fat, golden-haired women
with their sore eyes&mdash;Caterina Cornaro and
the rest. Rome is a crystal in which I seem
to see faces of dear women, women who lived
and loved and saw the sun set behind that
rampart of low hills&mdash;Virginia, the Greek
slave Acte, Agnes, Cecilia, who sang as she
lay dying in her house over there in the
Trasteverine quarter. Ah, I shall go away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and have the nostalgia of Rome to the end
of my life.&rdquo; He paused to light another
cigarette. &ldquo;Come and look at the picture.
I have not dared to see it again myself since
I came back last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door of his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">atelier</i> was open; he
clattered up the steep wooden stairs and she
followed him. The canvas was set up on an
easel facing the great north light. Camille
went up to it and then backed away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was smiling. &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I shall work on it to-day and to-morrow.
Get ready now while I prepare my palette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her critically as she took her
place. The change in her was indefinable,
but he was aware of it. She seemed to be
listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel a draught from the door?&rdquo;
he asked presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I should like it shut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nerves. You need a tonic and probably
a change of air and scene. There is nothing
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. Camille was kind,
but he could not help her. He could not
make the earth open and swallow Tor di
Rocca, and sometimes she felt that nothing
less than that would satisfy her, and that
such a summary ending would contribute
greatly to her peace of mind.</p>

<p>She had not seen the Prince for two days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and she was beginning to hope that he had
gone away, but she was not yet able to feel
free of him. Rosina had come home with her
every night from Varini&rsquo;s. Once he had
followed them, and twice he had come up the
stairs and knocked at the door. There had
been hours when she had been safe from him,
but she had not known them, and the strain,
the constant pricking fear of him, was telling
upon her. Every day youth and strength and
hope seemed to be slipping away and leaving
her less able to do and to endure. She dared
not look forward, as Camille did, to the end of
life. He would die in his bed, full of years
and honour, a great artist, a master, the
president of many societies, but she&mdash;</p>

<p>Sometimes, as she stood facing the semi-circle
of men at Varini&rsquo;s, and listened to the
busy scratching of charcoal on paper, to
Bembi&rsquo;s heavy breathing, and to the ticking
of the clock, she wondered if she had done
wrong in taking this way of bread earning.
Certainly there could be no turning back.
The step, once taken, was irrevocable. If
artists employed her she would go on, but she
could get no other work if this failed. If this
failed there must be another struggle between
flesh and spirit, and this time it would be
decisive&mdash;one or other must prevail. Though
she dreaded it she knew it was inevitable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Camille stood in need of her
ministrations. He had arranged to show his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
work on the fifteenth of April, and now he
seemed to regard that date as thrice accursed.
Often when she came in the morning she
would find him prowling restlessly to and fro,
or sitting with his head in his hands staring
gloomily at the parquet flooring and sighing
like a furnace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate having to invite people who do not
know anything, who cannot tell an etching
from an oil,&rdquo; he said irritably. &ldquo;I cannot
suffer their ridiculous comments gladly. I
would rather have six teeth pulled out than
hear my Aholibah called pretty. <em>Pretty!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They cannot say anything wrong about
the picture of me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is splendid.
M&rsquo;sieur le Directeur says so, and I am sure it
is. And your Venice sketches look so well
on the screen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be there,&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;If
you are not there I shall burst into tears and
run away.&rdquo; Then he laughed. &ldquo;I am always
like this. You should see me in Paris on the
eve of the opening of the Salon. A pitiable
wreck! I had no angel to console me there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her hands with unusual fervour.</p>

<p>The girl had not really meant to come at
first, but she yielded to his persuasions. &ldquo;I
will look after the food and drink then,&rdquo; she
said, and she spent herself on the decoration
of the tea-table. They went to Aragno&rsquo;s
together in the morning to get cakes and
bonbons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
&ldquo;What flowers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She chose mimosa, and he bought a great
mass of the fragrant golden boughs, and a
bunch of violets for her.</p>

<p>Camille knew a good many people in Rome,
and all those he had asked came. The Prix
de Rome men were the first arrivals. They
came in a body, and on the stroke of the hour
named on the invitation cards. Camille
watched their faces eagerly as they crowded
in and came to a stand before his picture;
they knew, and if they approved he cared
little for the verdict of all Rome.</p>

<p>Gontrand was the first to break rather a
long silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delicious!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is a triumph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Camille flushed with pleasure as the others
echoed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scheme of whites,&rdquo; &ldquo;The fine
quality,&rdquo; &ldquo;So pure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One after the other they went across the
room to talk to the model, who stood by the
tea-table waiting to serve them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wonderful, mademoiselle. If only
you would sit for me I might hope to achieve
something too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When M&rsquo;sieur Michelin has done with
me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You like the picture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is adorable&mdash;as you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other people were coming now. Camille
stayed by the door to receive them while his
friend Gontrand showed the drawings in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
portfolio, explained the Campagna sketches,
and handed plates of cake and sweets. When
Olive made fresh tea he brought her more
sliced lemons from the lumber room, where
Rosina was washing the cups.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am useful but not disinterested. Persuade
Camille to let you sit for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will not be here in the summer,&rdquo;
she said wistfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coffee, madame? These cakes are not
very sweet. Yes, I was M&rsquo;sieur Michelin&rsquo;s
model. Yes, it is a beautiful picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd thinned towards six o&rsquo;clock,
and there was no one now at the far end of
the room but a man who seemed to be looking
at the sketches on the screen. Olive thought
she might take a cup of tea herself, and she
was pouring it out when he turned and
came towards her. It was Tor di Rocca.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said smilingly, &ldquo;the girl in
Michelin&rsquo;s picture reminded me of you, but
I did not realise that you were indeed the
&lsquo;Jeune Fille.&rsquo; I have been away from
Rome these last few days. Have you missed
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hot brown eyes lingered over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like a cup of coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her hand shook so as she gave it to him
that much was spilled on the floor. She had
pitied him once; he remembered that as
he saw how she shrank from him. &ldquo;Michelin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
has been more fortunate than I have,&rdquo; he
said deliberately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be at home here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you must follow the bent of your
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must,&rdquo; he agreed as he stood
aside to let her pass. She had defied him that
night in Florence. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she had said.
And now he saw that she smiled at Camille
as she went by him into the further room,
and the old bad blood stirred in him and he
ached with a fierce jealousy.</p>

<p>She had denied him. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she had said.</p>

<p>As he joined the group of men by the door
Gontrand turned to him. &ldquo;Ah, Prince, have
you heard that Michelin has already sold his
picture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not surprised,&rdquo; the Italian answered
suavely. &ldquo;If I was rich&mdash;but I am not. Who
is the happy man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That stout grey-haired American who
left half an hour since. Did you notice him?
He is Vandervelde, the great millionaire art
collector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May one ask the price?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight thousand francs,&rdquo; answered Camille.
He looked tired, but his blue eyes were very
bright. &ldquo;I am glad, and yet I shall be sorry
to part with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will still have the charming original,&rdquo;
the Prince said not quite pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
There was a sudden silence. The men all
waited for Camille&rsquo;s answer. Beyond, in the
next room, they heard the two girls splashing
the water, clattering the cups and plates.</p>

<p>The young Frenchman paused in the act
of striking a match. He looked surprised.
&ldquo;But this is the original. I have made no
copy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant&mdash;&rdquo; The Prince stopped short.
After all, he thought, he goes well who goes
slowly.</p>

<p>Camille was waiting. &ldquo;You meant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tor di Rocca had had time to think.
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said sweetly.</p>

<p>Silence was again ensuing but Gontrand
flung himself into the breach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Duchess said she wanted her daughter&rsquo;s
portrait painted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said the same to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Camille suppressed a yawn. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Qui vivra verra.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was glad when they were all gone,
Gontrand and Tor di Rocca and the rest, and
he could stretch himself and sigh, and sing
at the top of his voice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Nicholas, je vais me pendre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qu&rsquo;est-ce que tu vas dire de cela?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Si vous vous pendez ou v&rsquo;vous pendez pas<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&Ccedil;a m&rsquo;est ben egal, Mam&rsquo;zelle.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Si vous vous pendez ou v&rsquo;vous pendez pas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, laissez moi planter mes chous!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
When Olive came out of the inner room
presently he told her that he had sold the
&ldquo;Jeune Fille.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Duchess has nearly
commissioned me to paint her M&eacute;lanie. It
went off well, don&rsquo;t you think so? Come at
nine to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you want me. Good-night, M&rsquo;sieur
Camille,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you coming,
Rosina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you wait for her?&rdquo; he asked
curiously. &ldquo;I should not have thought you
had much in common.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is my friend. She knows I do not
care to be alone.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>


<p>When Olive came to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">atelier</i> on the following
morning Camille was not there, but the
door was open and he had left a note on the
table for her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I have had a letter from the Duchess.
She is leaving Rome to-day but she wants
to see me before she goes. It must be about
her daughter&rsquo;s portrait. I must go to her
hotel, but I shall drive both ways and be back
in half an hour. Wait for me.&mdash;C. M.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Olive took off her hat and coat as usual
behind the screen. She was choosing a book
from the tattered row of old favourites on the
shelf when she heard a step outside. She
listened, thinking that it was Camille, and
fearing that the commission had not been
given him. It was not like him to be so
silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would be singing&mdash;&rdquo; she
stopped short.</p>

<p>Filippo came on into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieur Michelin is out,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the porter told me. You do not think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
I want to see him. Will you come with me to
Albano to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then. Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your work! I see you believe you can
do without me now. How long do you think
you will be able to earn money in this way?
All these men will be leaving Rome soon. The
schools will be closed until next October.
You will have to choose between the devil and
the deep sea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the good of talking about it?&rdquo;
she said wearily. &ldquo;I know I have nothing
to look forward to. I know that. Please
go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that you have cost me more
than any other woman I have ever met?
You injured me; will you make no amends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;So you are the victim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said passionately, &ldquo;I told you
before that I suffered, and you believed me
then. Is it my fault that I am made like
this? Since that night in Florence when I
held you in my arms I have had no peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You behaved very badly. I can&rsquo;t think
why I let myself be sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Badly! Some men would, but I loved
you even then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked wistfully towards the door.
&ldquo;I wish you would go. There are so many
other women.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
&ldquo;I love you, I want you,&rdquo; he answered,
and he caught her in his arms and held her
in spite of her struggles. &ldquo;I have you!&rdquo;
He forced her head down upon his breast and
kissed her mouth. She thought the hateful
pressure of his lips, the hateful fire of his eyes
would kill her, and when, at last, she wrenched
herself away she screamed with the despairing
violence of some trapped, wild thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Camille! Camille!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to her that if he did not hear her
this must be the end of all, and she suffered
an agony of terror. She thanked God as the
door below was flung to and he came running
up the stairs.</p>

<p>The Prince let her go and half turned to
meet him, but Camille was not inclined to
parley. He struck, and struck hard. Filippo
slipped on the polished floor, tried to recover
himself, and fell heavily at the girl&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>He got up at once, and the two men stood
glaring at each other. Olive looked from
one to the other. &ldquo;It was nothing. I am
sorry,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;He was trying
to&mdash;I was frightened. It was nothing,
really, but&mdash;but I am glad you came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; the Frenchman said grimly.
His blue eyes were grown grey as steel. &ldquo;I
am waiting, Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little blood had sprung from Filippo&rsquo;s
cut lip and run down his chin. He wiped it
with his handkerchief and looked thoughtfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
at the stain on the white linen before he
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is your friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ren&eacute; Gontrand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Filippo, it
was your fault. Can&rsquo;t you be sorry and
forget? Camille!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tor di Rocca was looking at her now with
the old insolent smile in his red-brown eyes.
&ldquo;Ah, you said &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; but presently you
will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he left them.</p>

<p>Olive expected to be &ldquo;poored,&rdquo; but Camille,
as it seemed, deliberately took no notice of
her. She watched him picking a stick of
charcoal from the accumulation of odd
brushes, pens and pencils on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a handsome devil it is. Lean,
lithe and brown. He should go naked as a
faun; such things roamed about the primeval
woods seeking what they might devour. I
wish I had asked him to sit for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to his easel and began to sketch a
head on the canvas he had prepared for the
Rosamund. &ldquo;He has the short Neronic
upper lip,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>Olive lost patience. &ldquo;I wonder you had
the heart to risk spoiling its contour,&rdquo; she said
resentfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With my fist, you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&mdash;I am very sorry&mdash;&rdquo; she began. He
saw that she was crying, and he was perplexed,
not quite understanding what she wanted of
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What am I to say to you?&rdquo; He came
over and sat down beside her, and she let him
hold her hand. &ldquo;I know so little&mdash;not even
your name. I have asked no questions, but
of course I saw&mdash;&nbsp;Why do you not go back
to your friends?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She dried her eyes. &ldquo;I have cousins in
Milan, but I have lost their address, and they
would not be able to help me. I have burnt
my boats. I used to give lessons, but it was
not easy to find pupils, and then I met Rosina.
I cannot go back to being a governess after
being a model. I have done no wrong, but no
one would have me if they knew. You see
one has to go on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you known Tor di Rocca long?
He was here last winter. He has a villa
somewhere outside Rome. I think it belonged
to his mother. She was an Orsini.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not going to fight him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside, in the ilex wood, birds were calling
to one another. The sun gilded the green of the
gnarled old trees; it had rained in the night,
and the garden was sweet with the scent of
moist earth. The young man sighed. He
had meant to take his &ldquo;little brother&rdquo; into
the Campagna this April day to see the spring
pageant of the skies, to hear the singing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
larks high up at heaven&rsquo;s gate, the tinkling of
sheep bells, the gurgling of water springs half
hidden in the green lush grass that grows in
the shadow of the ruined Claudian aqueducts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Camille, answer me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got up and went back to his easel.
&ldquo;You must run away now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t work this morning. I think I shall
go to Naples for a few days, but I will let you
know when I return. We must get on with the
&lsquo;Rosamund.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went obediently to put on her hat,
but the face she saw reflected in the little
hanging mirror was pale and troubled. He
came with her to the door, and when she gave
him her hand he bent to kiss it. Her eyes
filled again with tears. He will be killed, she
thought, and for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fight! For my sake, don&rsquo;t. I
shall begin to think that I am a creature of
ill-omen. They say some women are like
that; they have the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mal occhio</i>; they give
sorrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is absurd,&rdquo; he said roughly, and then,
in a changed voice, &ldquo;Good-bye, child.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>


<p>Olive walked home to Ripetta. She felt tired
and shaken, and unhappily conscious of some
effort that must be made presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be killed&mdash;and for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;For
me.&rdquo; &ldquo;For me.&rdquo; She heard that echo
of her thought through all the clamour
of the streets, the shrill cries, the clatter of
hoofs, the rattling of wheels over the cobble
stones. She heard it as she climbed the stairs
to her room. When she had taken off her hat
and coat she poured some eau-de-cologne
with water into a cup and drank it&mdash;not this
time to Italy or the joy of life. She lay down
on her bed and stayed there for a while,
not resting, but thinking or trying to think.</p>

<p>Was she really a sort of number thirteen,
a grain of spilt salt, ill-omened, disastrous?
Camille would not think so; but it seemed
to her that she had never been able to make
anyone happy, and that there must be some
taint in her therefore, some flaw in her nature.</p>

<p>Now, here, at last, was a thing well worth
doing. She must risk her soul, lose it, perhaps,
or rather, exchange it for a man&rsquo;s life. She
had hoarded it hitherto, had been miserly,
selfish, seeking to save the poor thing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
though it were a pearl of price. Now she
saw herself as the veriest rag of flesh parading
virtue, useless, comfortless, helpless, clinging
to her code, and justifying all the trouble she
gave to others by a reference to the impalpable,
elusive and possible non-existent
immortal and inner self she had held so dear.
She was ashamed. Ah, now at last she would
give ungrudgingly. Her feet should not falter,
nor her eyes be dimmed by any shadow of fear
or of regret, though she went by perilous ways
to an almost certain end.</p>

<p>Soon after noon she got up and prepared
to face the world again, and towards three
o&rsquo;clock she returned to the Villa Medici.
She had to ring the porter&rsquo;s bell as the garden
gate was shut, and the old man came grumblingly
as usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Michelin will see no one. Did
he not tell you so this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have come for Monsieur Gontrand,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>She hoped now above all things to find the
black Gascon alone in his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">atelier</i> near the
Belvedere. The first move depended upon
him, and there was no time to spare. She
determined to await his return in the wood if
he were out, but there was no need. He
opened his door at once in answer to her
knocking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come&mdash;may I speak to you for a
moment?&rdquo; she began rather confusedly. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
looked tired and worried, and was so evidently
alarmed at the sight of her, and afraid of
what she was going to say next, that she could
hardly help smiling. &ldquo;I want to ask you
two questions. I hope you will answer them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to please you, mademoiselle,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried on. &ldquo;First, when are they
going to fight? Oh, tell me, tell me! I know
you were to be with him. I know you are
his friend. Be mine too! What harm can it
do? I swear I will keep it secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, if you promise that,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It is to be to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I really cannot tell
you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the hour is fixed. It will not be
changed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the Prince preferred the early morning,
but Michelin has an appointment he must
keep with Vandervelde at noon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing will persuade him to alter it
then?&rdquo; she insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; she said sighing. &ldquo;Good-bye,
M&rsquo;sieur Gontrand. You&mdash;you will do
your best for Camille.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may rely on me,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>She went down the steps of Trinit&agrave; del
Monte, and across the Piazza di Spagna to the
English book-shop at the corner, where she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
bought a <i>Roman Herald</i>. Three minutes
study of the visitors&rsquo; list sufficed to inform
her that the Prince was staying at the Hotel
de Russie close by. The afternoon was
waning, and already the narrow streets of the
lower town were in shadow; soon the shops
would be lit up and gay with the gleam of
marbles, the glimmer of Roman pearls and
silks, and the green, grotesque bronzes that
strangers buy.</p>

<p>Olive walked down the Via Babuino past
the ugly English church, crossed the road,
and entered the hall of the hotel in the wake
of a party of Americans. They went on
towards the lift and left her uncertain which
way to turn, so she appealed to the gold-laced,
gigantic, and rather awful porter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prince Tor di Rocca?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He softened at her mention of the illustrious
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will go into the lounge there I will
send to see if the Prince is in. What name
shall I say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Agar. I have no card with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She chose a window-seat near a writing-table
at the far end of the room, and there
Filippo found her when he came in five
minutes later. He was prepared for anything
but the smile in the blue eyes lifted to his,
and he paled as he took the hand she gave
and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said fervently, &ldquo;if you were
always kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a week, or a month? But you need
not answer me. Filippo, I should like some
tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;Forgive
me,&rdquo; and he hurried away to order it.</p>

<p>When he returned his dark face was radiant.
&ldquo;Do you know that is the second time you
have called me by my name? You said
Filippo this morning. Ah, I heard you, and
I have thought of it since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl hardened her heart. She realised&mdash;she
had always realised that this man was
dangerous. A fire consumed him. It was a
fire that blazed up to destroy, no pleasant
light and warmth upon the hearth of a good
life, but women were apt to flutter, moth-like,
into the flame of it nevertheless.</p>

<p>He sat down beside her and took her hand
in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I was violent this morning; I
could not help myself. I am a Tor di Rocca.
It would be so easy for you to make me
happy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She listened quietly.</p>

<p>A waiter brought the tea and set it on a
little table between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had coffee yesterday,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
seems years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have forgotten yesterday, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Incipit vita
nuova</i>! Do you remember I came to you
dressed in Dante&rsquo;s red <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">lucco</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are not a bit like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came to the point presently. &ldquo;Filippo,
you say you want me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than anything in this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes met his and held them. &ldquo;Well,
if you will get out of fighting M&rsquo;sieur Michelin
I will come to you&mdash;meet you&mdash;anywhere
and at any hour after noon to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you make conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I get out of fighting him? The
man struck me, insulted me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you know why!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have asked your pardon for that,&rdquo; he
said with an effort that brought the colour
into his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that is not enough. I don&rsquo;t
choose that this unpleasantness should go
any further. Write a letter to him now&mdash;we
will concoct it together&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I will be
nice to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled at him, and there was no shadow
of fear or of regret in the blue eyes that
looked towards the almost certain end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be let down easily,&rdquo; he said
unwillingly. &ldquo;I am not going to lick his
boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat down at the writing-table together,
and she began to dictate. &ldquo;Just scribble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
this, and if it does you can make a fair copy
afterwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Monsieur Michelin</span>,&mdash;On reflection
I understand that your conduct this
morning was justifiable from your point of
view, and I withdraw&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Filippo laid down the pen. &ldquo;I shall not
say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin again then,&rdquo; she said patiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have been asked to write to you by a
third person whom I wish to please. She tells
me that this morning&rsquo;s unpleasantness resulted
from a misunderstanding. She says she has
deceived you, and she hopes that you will
forgive her. I suppose from what she has
said that your hasty action was excusable, as
you thought her other than she is, and I
think that you may now regret it and agree
with me that this need go no farther&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is better for me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She took the pen from him and
wrote under his signature: &ldquo;You will be
sorry to know that your child is a liar. Try
to forget her existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can send it now by someone who
must wait for an answer,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I
shall stay here until it comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said sulkily, and he went
out into the hall to confer with the porter.
&ldquo;An important letter, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Eccellenza</i>? A <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetturino</i>
will take it for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olive heard the opening and shutting of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
doors, the shrill whistle answered by harsh,
raucous cries, the rattling of wheels. Filippo
came back to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have done my part.&rdquo; Then, looking at
her closely, he saw that she was very pale. &ldquo;Is
all you have implied and I have written
true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must love him very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? Not at all, as you understand love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ensuing half-hour seemed long to the
girl; Filippo talked desultorily, but there
were intervals of silence. She was too tired
to attempt to answer him, and, besides, his
evident restlessness, his inattention, afforded
her some acrid amusement. He was like a
boy, eager in pursuit of the bird in the bush,
heedless of the poor thing fluttering, dying in
his hand. It was now near the dinner-hour,
and people were coming into the lounge to
await the sounding of the gong; from where
Olive sat she could see all the entrances and
exits&mdash;as in a glass darkly&mdash;in the clouded
surface of a mirror that hung on the wall and
reflected the white gleam of shirt fronts, the
shimmer of silks, and she was quick to note
that Filippo was interested in what she saw
as a pink blur.</p>

<p>His love was as fully winged for flight as
any Beast of the book of Revelations; it was
swift as a sword to pierce and be withdrawn.
He could not be altogether loyal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
for a day. Olive&rsquo;s heart was filled with pity
for the women who had cared.</p>

<p>When, at last, the answer to the letter
came, the Prince gave it to her to read. It
was very short, a mere scrawl of scarlet ink
on the brown, rough-edged paper that was
one of Camille&rsquo;s affectations.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;My zeal was evidently misplaced and I
regret its excess.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Olive was speechless; her eyes were dimmed,
her throat ached with tears. How easily he
believed the worst&mdash;this man who had been
her friend. She rose to go, but Filippo laid
a detaining hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo; He had already told her
where and when to meet him, and had given
her two keys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want me?&rdquo; she said
hurriedly. &ldquo;There are so many women in
your life. You remind me of the South
American Republic that made&mdash;and shot&mdash;seventeen
presidents in six months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed. &ldquo;Do I? You remind me
of an eel, or a little grey mouse trying
to get out of a trap. There is no way out,
my dear, unless, of course, you want me
to kill your Frenchman. I am a good
shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked for pink as she went out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
room, and saw a very pretty woman in rose-coloured
tulle sitting alone and near the
door.</p>

<p>She had given ungrudgingly, unfaltering,
and there was no shadow of regret in her eyes;
it was nothing to her that he should care for
this other little body, for bare white shoulders
and a fluff of yellow hair. He had never been
more to her than a means to an end, and he
was to be that now.</p>

<p>She took a tram from the Piazza del Popolo
to the Rotonda. There was a large ironmonger&rsquo;s
shop at the corner; she remembered
having noticed it before. She went in and
asked to look at some of the pistols they had
in the window. Several were brought out
for her to see, and she chose a small one.
The young man who served her showed her
how to load it and pull the trigger. He
wrapped it in brown paper and made a loop
in the string for her to carry it by. She
thanked him.</p>

<p>The bells of all the churches were ringing
the Ave Maria when she left the Hotel de
Russie an hour ago, and it was dark when
she reached her own room. The stars were
bright, shining through a rift of clouds that
hid the crescent moon. Olive laid the
awkwardly-shaped parcel she carried down
upon the table while she lit her candle.
Then she got her scissors and cut the string.
This was the key of a door through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
which she must pass. Death was the way
out.</p>

<p>The little flame of the candle gleamed on
the polished steel. It was almost a pretty
thing, so smooth and shining. It was well
worth the money she had paid for it; it
was going to be useful, indispensable to-morrow.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in spite of herself, she began to
think of her grave. It would be dug soon.
She would be brought to it in a black covered
cart. No prayers would be said, and there
would be no sound at all but that of the earth
falling upon the coffin.</p>

<p>She sprang up, her face chalk white, her
eyes wide and dark with terror. She was
afraid, horribly afraid of this lonely and
violent end. Jean would never know that she
died rather than let another man&mdash;Jean
would never know&mdash;Jean&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said aloud
piteously.</p>

<p>She was trembling so that she had to cling
to the banisters as she went down the stairs
to save herself from falling. There was a
post-office at the corner. She went in and
explained that she wanted to send a telegram.
The young woman behind the counter
glanced at the clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where to? You have half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Florence.&rdquo; She wrote it and gave
it in.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
&ldquo;To <span class="smcap">Jean Avenel</span>, Villa Fiorelli, Settignano,
Florence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would help me come if you can
to the Villino Bella Vista at Albano to-morrow
soon after noon; watch for me and follow
me in. I know it may not be possible, but
the danger is real to me and I want you so
much. In any case remember that my heart
was yours only.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Olive.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>


<p>Jean sat leaning forward that he might see
the road. The night was dark, starless, and
very wet, and he and the chauffeur were all
streaming with rain and splashed with liquid
mud that spattered up from the car wheels.
Now and again they rattled over the rough
cobble stones of a village street, but the way
for the most part lay through deep woods
and by mountain gorges. The roar of Arno in
flood, swollen with melted snows, and hurrying
on its way to the sea, was with them for a
while, but other sounds there were none save the
rustling of leaves in the coverts, the moaning
of wind in the tree-tops, the drip-drip of the
rain, and the steady throbbing of the car.</p>

<p>When the darkness lightened to the grey
glimmer of a cheerless dawn Jean changed
places with the chauffeur; Vincenzo was a
careful driver, and he dared not trust his own
impatience any longer. His hands were
numbed with cold, and now he took off his
gloves to chafe them, but first he felt in his
inner pocket for the flimsy sheets of paper
that lay there safe against his heart.</p>

<p>He had been sitting alone at the piano in
the music-room, not playing, but softly touching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the keys and dreaming in the dark, when
Hilaire came in to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not write to her after all. She
has sent for you. Hear what she says.&rdquo; He
stood in the doorway to read the message by
the light that filtered in from the hall. Jean
listened carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The car&mdash;I must tell Vincenzo.&rdquo; The
lines of the strong, lean face seemed to have
softened, and the brown eyes were very bright.
His brother smiled as he laid a kindly hand
upon his arm. &ldquo;The car will be round soon.
I have sent word, and you have plenty of
time. Assure Olive of my brotherly regard,
and tell her that my books are still waiting to
be catalogued. If she will come here for a
while she will be doing a kindness to a lonely
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what she is frightened of,&rdquo;
Jean said thoughtfully, and frowning a little.
&ldquo;She says &lsquo;was yours&rsquo; too; I don&rsquo;t like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you must do your best for her,&rdquo;
Hilaire answered in his most matter-of-fact
tone. &ldquo;Be prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean agreed, and when he went to get
ready he transferred a pistol from a drawer
of the bureau to his coat pocket. &ldquo;I shall
bring her back with me if I can. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun shone for a few minutes after its
rising through a rift in the clouds, but soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
went in again; the rain still poured down,
and the distance was hidden in mist that clung
to the hillsides and filled each ravine and
cranny in the rocks. They were near Orvieto
when the car broke down; Vincenzo was out
on the road at once, but his master sat quite
still. He could not endure the thought of
any delay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Will it take long?&rdquo; He
had forced himself to wait a minute before
he asked the question, but still his lips felt
stiff, and all the colour had gone out of
them.</p>

<p>The man reassured him. &ldquo;It is nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean went to help him, and soon they were
able to go on again.</p>

<p>They came presently to the fen lands&mdash;the
Campagna that so greatly needs the magic
and glamour of the Roman sunshine, the
vault of the blue sky above, and the sound of
larks singing to adorn it. It seemed a desolate
and dreary waste, wind-swept, and shivering
under the lash of the rain on such a
morning as this, and the car was a very small
thing moving in that apparently illimitable
plain along a road that might be endless.
Jean saw a herd of the wild, black buffaloes
standing in a pool at the foot of a broken
arch of the Claudian aqueduct, and now and
again he caught a glimpse of fragments of
masonry, or a ruined tower, ancient stronghold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of one or other of the robber barons who
preyed on Rome-ward pilgrims in the age of
faith and rapine.</p>

<p>They reached Albano soon after eleven
o&rsquo;clock, and Jean left his man in the car while
he went in to the Ristorante of the Albergo
della Posta. He ordered a cup of coffee, and
sat down at one of the little marble tables near
the door to drink it. There was no one else
in the place at the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me the way to the Villino
Bella Vista?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter looked at him curiously. &ldquo;It
is down in the olive woods and quite near the
lake, and you must go to it by a lane from
the Galleria di Sopra, the upper road to Castel
Gandolfo.&rdquo; After a momentary hesitation
he added, &ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scusi!</em> But are you thinking
of taking it, signore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean started. It had not occurred to him
that the house might be empty. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; he answered cautiously. &ldquo;Has it been
to let long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;The Princess
Tor di Rocca spent her last years there, alone,
and after her death the agent in Rome found
tenants. But lately no one has come to it,
even to see.&rdquo; He lowered his voice. &ldquo;The
place has a bad name hereabouts. The
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">contadini</i>&mdash;rough, ignorant folk, signore&mdash;say
she still walks in the garden at moonrise,
waiting for the husband and son who never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
came; and the women who go to wash their
linen in the lake will not come back that
way at night for fear of seeing her dead eyes
peering at them through the bars of the
gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is very interesting,&rdquo; Jean said
appreciatively. He finished his coffee, paid
for it with a piece of silver, and waited to light
a cigarette before he went out.</p>

<p>Vincenzo sat still in the car, a model of
patient impassivity, but he turned a hungry
eye on his master as he came down the
steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go and get something to eat.
I shall drive up to the Galleria di Sopra, and
you must follow me there. You will find the
car at the side of the road. Stay with it until
I come, and if anyone asks questions you need
not answer them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean drove up the steep hill towards the
lake. The rain was still heavy, and the
squalid streets of the little town were running
with mud. He turned to the left by the
Calvary at the foot of the ilex avenue by the
Capuchin church, and stopped the car some
way further down the road. The lane the
waiter had told him of was not hard to find.
It was a narrow path between high walls of
olive orchards; it led straight down to the
lake, and the entrance to the Villino was quite
close to the water&rsquo;s edge. Nothing could be
seen of it from the lane but the name painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
on the gate-posts and one glimpse of a shuttered
window, forlorn and viewless as a blind eye,
and half hidden by flowering laurels. Jean
looked at his watch. It was ten minutes to
twelve, and she had written &ldquo;after noon,&rdquo;
but he could not be sure that she had not
come already, and since he had heard the
name of Tor di Rocca he was more than ever
anxious to be with her.</p>

<p>He tried the gate but it was locked; there
was nothing for it but to climb the wall, and
as he was light and active he scrambled over
without much difficulty and landed in a green
tangle of roses and wild vines. He knocked
at the house door, and stood for a while
listening to the empty answering echoes and
to the drip-drip of rain from the eaves.
Evidently there was no one there. He drew
back into the shrubberies; great showers of
drops were shaken down on him from the
gold-powdered mimosa blossoms that met
above his head; he shook himself impatiently,
like a dog that is disturbed while on guard.
From where he stood he could see the gate
and the grass-grown path that led from it to
the house. The time passed very slowly. He
looked at his watch four times in the next
fifteen minutes, and he was beginning to
wonder if he had not left Florence on a fool&rsquo;s
errand when Olive came.</p>

<p>He saw her fumbling with the key; it was
hard to turn in the rusty lock, and she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to close her umbrella and stand it against the
wall so as to have both hands free. The gate
swung open slowly, creaking on its warped
hinges. Jean noticed that she left it unlatched
and that she looked back over her shoulder
twice as she came down the path, as though
she thought someone might be following
her.</p>

<p>She opened the house door with a key she
had and went in, and he came after her. He
stood for a moment on the threshold listening.
She was hurrying from room to room, opening
the shutters and the windows and letting in
the light and air; the doors banged after her,
and muslin curtains flapped like wings as the
wind blew them.</p>

<p>His heart was beating so that he thought
she must hear it before she saw him, before
his step sounded in the passage. As he came
in she gave a sort of little cry and ran to him,
and he put his arms about her and kissed her
again and again; her dear lips that were wet
and cold with rain, her soft brown hair, the
curves of cheek and chin that were as sweet
to feel as to see. One small hand held the
lapel of his coat, and he was pleasantly aware
of the other being laid about his neck. She
had wanted him so much&mdash;and he had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, you are here, Jean. Oh, if
you knew how frightened I have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her once more, and then, framing
her face with his hands, he looked down into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
her eyes. The blue eyes yearned to his, but
there was fear in them still, and he saw
the colour he had brought into her cheeks
fading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not worth all the trouble I have
given you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he said, smiling. &ldquo;Hilaire
sent you a long message, but I want to hear
what we are supposed to be doing here
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Hilaire!... Jean, you won&rsquo;t be
angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t promise anything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
shall probably be furious. But in any case,
if it is going to be a long story we may as well
make ourselves at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here! I must tell you quickly,
before he comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He noticed that she looked towards the
door, and he understood that she was listening
fearfully for the creaking of the gate, the
sound of footsteps on the path outside, the
turning of the key in the lock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tor di Rocca, I suppose? When is he
coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between one and two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have at least half an hour then,&rdquo;
he said comfortably, and drew her closer
to him with his arm about her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first came to Rome I tried for
weeks to get something to do, but no one
seemed to want lessons. Then one day Signora
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Aurelia&rsquo;s sister told me how poor she was.
She cried, and I was very much upset because
I felt I was a burden, and that very afternoon
I found out a way of making money ...
Jean, you won&rsquo;t be angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dearest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I became a model&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, but he
said nothing and she went on. &ldquo;I sat for
one man only after the first week, and he was
always good and kind to me, always. He
painted a picture of me&mdash;I think you would
like it&mdash;and the day before yesterday he
had a show of his work. A lot of people
came. I did not see Prince Tor di Rocca,
but he was there, and after a while he
spoke to me. I had met him before and I
understood from what he said that Mamie
Whittaker had broken her engagement with
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning M&rsquo;sieur Camille had to go
out, and I was alone in the studio when the
Prince came in and tried to make love to me.
I was frightened, and I screamed, and just
then Camille returned, and he knocked him
down. He got up again at once. Nothing
much was said, and he went away, but I
understood that they were going to fight. I
went home and thought about it, and when
I realised that one or other of them might be
killed I felt I could not bear it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so afraid of death, Jean. I try to
believe in a future life, but that will be different,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and I want the people I love in this one; just
human, looking tired sometimes and shabby,
or happy and pleased about things. I remember
my mother had a blue hat that
suited her, and I can&rsquo;t think of it now without
tears, because I long to see her pinning it on
before the glass and asking me if it is straight,
and I suppose I shall never see or hear that
again, even if we do meet in heaven. Death
is so absolutely the end. If only people are
alive distance and absence don&rsquo;t really matter;
there is always hope. And then, you know,
Camille is so brilliant; it would be a loss
to France, to the whole world, if he was
killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say his name was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Camille Michelin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know him then. He came to me
once in Paris, after a concert, and fell on my
neck without an introduction. Afterwards
he painted my portrait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is nice, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she said eagerly.</p>

<p>He assented. &ldquo;Well, go on. You could
not let them fight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to see the Prince at his hotel,
and I persuaded him to write a sort of
apology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You persuaded him. How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean, that man is the exact opposite of
the centurion&rsquo;s servant; say &lsquo;go&rsquo; and he
stays, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t do it&rsquo; and he does it. And I
once made the fatal mistake of telling him I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
could never love him. He did not want me
to before, but now&mdash;&nbsp;He is a spoilt boy
who only cares for the fruit that is forbidden
or withheld. It is the scaling of the orchard
wall that he enjoys; if he could walk in by
the gate in broad daylight I am sure he never
would, or, at any rate, he would soon walk out
again. I promised to come here alone to
meet him, and not to tell Camille, and I have
kept my promise. If you knew how frightened
I was.... I thought you might be away,
and that Hilaire perhaps could not come in
your stead, though I knew he would if it were
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man left her then and went to
the window, where he stood looking out
upon the driving mist and rain that made
the troubled waters of the lake seem
grey, and shrouded all the wooded hills
beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I had not come,&rdquo; he said
presently. &ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned upon her. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said
hardly, &ldquo;just that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took a small pistol from the pocket
of her loose sac coat and gave it to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you were going to shoot him? I
thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to still the quivering of her lips.
&ldquo;No, myself. Oh, I am not really inconsistent.
I told you I was afraid of death. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
will say all now and have done; I am afraid
of life too, with its long slow pains, and
most of all of what men call love. I don&rsquo;t
want to go on,&rdquo; she cried hysterically. &ldquo;I
am sick. I don&rsquo;t want to see, or hear, or
feel anything any more. I have had
enough. All this year I have struggled,
and people have been kind; but friendship
is a poor, weak thing, and love&mdash;love is
hateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; he said, and then, in a changed
voice, &ldquo;My darling, you will be better soon.
I must get you away from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gently he drew her hands away from her
face and lifted them to his lips; the soft
palms were wet with tears.</p>

<p>They were standing on the threshold of an
inner room. &ldquo;You can go in here until I
have done with Tor di Rocca,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But first I must tell you that Gertrude has
written to me asking me to get a divorce.
There is a man, of course, and the case will
not be defended. Olive, will you marry me
when I am free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jean, I&mdash;I am so glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will marry me then?&rdquo; he insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How thin you are, my dear. Just a very
nice bag of bones. Were&mdash;were you sorry
when I came away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You little torment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Answer
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ask again. I want to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A nightingale began to sing in the garden;
broken notes, a mere echo of what the stars
heard at night, but infinitely sweet as the soul
of a rose made audible; and as he sang a
sudden ray of sunshine shot the grey rain with
silver. It seemed to Jean that rose-sweetness
was all about him in this his short triumph
of love; that a flower&rsquo;s heart beat against his
own, that a flower&rsquo;s lips caressed the lean
darkness of his cheek. There were threads
of gold in the soft brown tangle of hair&mdash;gold
unalloyed as was the hard-won happiness that
made him feel himself invincible, panoplied
in an armour of joy that should defend them
from all slings and arrows. He was happy,
and so the world seemed full of music; there
was harmony in the swaying of tall dark
cypresses, moved by winds that strewed the
grass with torn petals of orange blossoms
from the trees by the lake side, in the clouds&rsquo;
processional, in the patter of rain on the green
shining laurel leaves.</p>

<p>Laurels&mdash;his laurels had been woven in
with rue, and latterly with rosemary for dear
remembrance; he had never cared greatly
for his fame and it seemed worthless to him
now that he had realised his dream and
gathered his rose.</p>

<p>He was impatient to be gone, to take the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
woman he loved out of this house of sad
memories, of empty echoes, of dust and rust
and decay. Already he seemed to feel the
rush of the cold night air, to hear the roar of
Arno, hurrying to the sea, above the steady
throbbing of the car; to see the welcoming
lights of home shining out of the dark at
the steep edge of the hills above Settignano.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the Prince,&rdquo; he said presently.
&ldquo;Am I to fight him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started. &ldquo;Oh, no! That would be
worse than ever. I thought you were too
English for that,&rdquo; she said na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>He smiled. &ldquo;Well, perhaps I am, but I
suppose there may be a bit of a scuffle. You
won&rsquo;t mind that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said helplessly.</p>

<p>A moment later they heard the gate
creak as it swung on its hinges. &ldquo;He is
coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They kissed hurriedly, with, on her side, a
passion of farewell, and he would have made
her go into the room beyond, but she clung
to him, crying incoherently. &ldquo;No ... no
... together ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tor di Rocca stopped short by the door;
the smile that had been in his hot eyes as
they met Olive&rsquo;s faded, and the short, Neronic
upper lip lifted in a sort of snarl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;How did you come here? This is my house,
Avenel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
&ldquo;I know it, and I do not wish to trespass
on your hospitality. You will excuse
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Prince stood in the way. &ldquo;I am
not a child to be played with. I&rsquo;ll not let
her go. You may leave us, however,&rdquo; he
added, and he stood aside as though to let
him pass.</p>

<p>Jean met his angry eyes. &ldquo;The lady is
unwilling. Let that be the end,&rdquo; he said
quietly.</p>

<p>Olive watched the Italian fearfully; his
face was writhen, and all semblance of beauty
had gone out of it; its gnawing, tearing,
animal ferocity was appalling. When he
called to her she moved instinctively nearer
to Jean, and then with the swift prescience
of love threw herself on his breast, tried to
shelter him, as the other drew his revolver
and fired.</p>

<p>Jean had his arm about her, but he let her
slip now and fall in a huddled heap at his feet.
She was safer there, and out of the way. The
two men exchanged several shots, but Jean&rsquo;s
went wide; he was hampered by his heavy
motor coat, and the second bullet had scored
its way through his flesh before he could get
at his weapon; there were four in his body
when he dropped.</p>

<p>Tor di Rocca leant against the wall; he
was unhurt, but he felt a little faint and sick
for the moment. Hurriedly he rehearsed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
what he should say to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Questore</i> presently.
He had met the girl in this house of his;
Avenel, her lover, had broken in upon them;
he had shot her and fired at the Prince himself,
but without effect, and he had killed him in
self-defence.</p>

<p>That was plain enough, but it was essential
that his should be the only version, and when
the smoke cleared away he crossed the room
to look at the two who must speak no word,
and to make sure.</p>

<p>The man was still alive for all the lead in
him; Tor di Rocca watched, with a sort of
cruel, boyish interest in the creature he had
maimed, as slowly, painfully, Jean dragged
himself a little nearer to where the girl lay,
tried to rise, and fell heavily. Surely he was
dead now&mdash;but no; his hands still clawed at
the carpet, and when Tor di Rocca stamped
on his fingers he moaned as he tried to
draw them away. Olive lived too, but
her breathing was so faint that it would
be easily stifled; the pressure of his hand
even, but Filippo shrank from that. He
could not touch the flesh that would be
dust presently because of him. He hesitated,
and then, muttering to himself, went
to take one of the cushions from the window
seat.</p>

<p>Out in the garden the nightingale had not
ceased to sing; the cypresses swayed in the
winds that shook the promise of fruit from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the trees; the green and rose and gold of a
rainbow made fair the clouds&rsquo; processional.
The world was still full of music, of transitory
life and joy, of dreams that have an
ending.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>


<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via!</em>&rdquo; said Vincenzo, and his black, oily
forefinger, uplifted, gave emphasis to his
words. &ldquo;There are no such things as ghosts.
This princess of yours cannot be seen at
moonrise, or at any other time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no room for faith in the swelled
head of young Italy, but the waiter was a
middle-aged man. He paused in the act of
re-filling the customer&rsquo;s cup. &ldquo;You do not
believe, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Tuscan looked at him with all the
scarcely-veiled contempt of the North for the
South. &ldquo;You tell me you are a Calabrian.
<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Si vede!</em> You listen to all the priests say;
you go down on your knees in the mud when
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">frati</i> are carrying a wax doll about the
roads; you think a splinter of bone from the
ribs of some fool who would not enjoy life
while it lasted will cure a dropsy or a broken
leg; you hope the rain will stop because a
holy toe-nail is exposed on the altar. Ghosts,
visions, miracles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincenzo Torrigiani was the son of a stone-cutter
in the village of Settignano, and he
had worked as a boy in the gardens of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Villa Fiorelli. After a while the master had
noticed and had taken a fancy to him, chiefly
on account of his ever-ready and unusually
dazzling and expansive smile, and he had
been sent to a garage in Milan for six months.
The quick-witted Florentine learned a great
many things in a short time besides the
necessary smattering of mechanics and the
management of cars, and on his return he
displayed many new airs and graces in addition,
fortunately, to the same old smile. Later on
he spent the obligatory two years in barracks,
in a regiment of Bersaglieri, and came back
to Avenel&rsquo;s service plus a still more varied
knowledge of the world, a waxed moustache,
and a superficial tendency to atheism. He
was always delighted to air his views, and he
fixed the shocked waiter now with a glittering
eye as he proceeded to recite his unbelief
at some length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God is merely man&rsquo;s idea of himself at his
best, and the devil is his idea of other people
at their worst,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you spend a night alone in this
haunted house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sicuro!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will have to if your master
takes the place. He has gone to look at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincenzo gulped down the last of his coffee.
&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said, but he was much too
Italian to understand that a man in a hurry
need not count his change twice over or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
bite every piece of silver to make sure
of it.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock when, having outdistanced
the pack of beggars that followed
at his heels through the narrow streets of the
town, he came out upon the broad, tree-shadowed
upper road. He had stopped for
a moment in the shelter of the high wall of the
Capuchin convent to light a cigarette, and
thereafter he went on unseeingly, in a brown
study. Had he or had he not paid two soldi
more than he should have done for the packet?
A Calabrian would cheat, if possible, of course.</p>

<p>When, after much mental arithmetic,
Vincenzo solved the problem to his own
satisfaction the little scrap of bad tobacco in
its paper lining was smoked out. He looked
at his watch, a Christmas present from Jean,
and seeing that it was past the hour he began
to wonder. There were no ghosts, and in
any case they were not dangerous in broad
daylight. There were no ghosts, but what
was the signorino doing all this while in an
empty house? The car was there, drawn
up at the side of the road under the trees, and
Vincenzo fussed round it, pulling the tarpaulin
covers more over the seats; he had them in
place when it occurred to him to look underneath
for the fur rug. It was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dio mio!</em>&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;It has
been stolen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone passing by must have seen it and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
taken it, probably someone with a cart, as it
would be heavy to carry. The thief could not
have gone far, and Vincenzo thought that if
he drove the car towards Castel Gandolfo he
might catch him, whoever he was&mdash;charcoal-burner
from the woods beyond Rocca di Papa,
peasant carting barrels of Frascati wine, or
perhaps a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">frate</i> from the convent. However,
he dared not attempt it as the signorino had
said &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a few minutes of miserable uncertainty,
during which he invoked the assistance of the
saints&mdash;&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Che fare! Che fare! Santa
Vergine, aiutatemi!</em>&rdquo; he decided to go and
find the signorino himself. He was half way
down the lane when he heard shots. He had
been hurrying, but he began to run then,
and the last echo had not died away when
he reached the gate of the Villino. It creaked
on its hinges as he passed in, but no one in the
house was listening for it now. He went in at
the door, and now he was very swift and silent,
very intent. There was a smell of powder in
the passage, and someone was moving about
in the room beyond. Vincenzo felt for the
long sharp knife in his hip pocket before he
softly turned the handle of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signore! What has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Filippo Tor di Rocca started violently and
uttered a sort of cry as he turned to see the
man who stood on the threshold staring at
him. There was a queer silence before he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
spoke, moistening his lips at almost every
word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;you heard shots, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant&rsquo;s quick eyes noted the recent
disorder of the room: chairs overturned,
white splinters of plaster fallen from the ceiling,
a mirror broken. Into what trap had his
master fallen? What was there hidden behind
the table&mdash;on the floor? There were scrabbled
finger-marks&mdash;red marks&mdash;in the dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was here with a lady whom I wished to
take this house when a man burst in upon us.
He shot her, and tried to shoot me, and I
drew upon him in self-defence.&rdquo; The Prince
spoke haltingly. He had not been prepared
to lie so soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with that cushion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Filippo looked down guiltily at the frilled
thing he held. &ldquo;I was going to put it under
her head,&rdquo; he began, but the other was not
listening. He had come forward into the room
and he had seen. The huddled heap of black
and grey close at the Prince&rsquo;s feet was human&mdash;a
woman&mdash;and he knew the young pale
face, veiled as it was in brown, loosened hair
threaded with gold. A woman; and the man
who lay there too, his dark head resting on her
breast, his lips laid against her throat, was his
master, Jean Avenel.</p>

<p>He uttered a hoarse cry of rage. &ldquo;Murderer!
You did it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tor di Rocca had recovered himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
somewhat and the bold, hard face was a mask
through which the red eyes gleamed wickedly.
&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he answered impatiently. &ldquo;It was
as I said. The man was mad with jealousy.
There is his pistol on the floor. I am going
now to inform the authorities and to fetch
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">carabinieri</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out, and Vincenzo did not try to
prevent him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signorino! signorino! answer me.
<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Madonna benedetta!</em> What shall I say to
Ser &rsquo;Ilario?&rdquo; The little man&rsquo;s face worked,
and tears ran down his cheeks as he knelt
there at his master&rsquo;s side, stooping to feel for
the fluttering of the faint breath, the beating
of the pulse of life. Surely there was no mortal
wound&mdash;the shoulder&mdash;yes; and the side,
and the right arm, since all the sleeve was
soaked in warm blood.</p>

<p>All those who have been dragged down into
the great darkness that shrouds the gate of
Death know that the first sense vouchsafed to
the returning soul is that of hearing. There
was a sound of the sea in Jean&rsquo;s ears, a weary
sound of wailing and distress, through which
words came presently by ones and twos and
threes. Words that seemed a long way off, and
yet near, as though they were stones dropped
upon him from a great height: ... signorina
... not mortal ... healed ... care ...
twenty masses to the Madonna at the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santissima
Annunziata</i> ...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Sight came next as the sea that had roared
about him seemed to ebb, leaving him still
on the shore of this world. He opened his
eyes and lay for a moment staring up at the
white ceiling until full consciousness returned,
and with it the sharp, stabbing pain of his
wounds, the acrid taste of blood in his mouth,
the remembrance of love. Olive.... Had
he not tried to reach her and failed? He
groaned as he turned his aching head now on
the pillow to see her where she lay.</p>

<p>Vincenzo had cared for his master, had slit
up that red, wet sleeve with his sharp knife,
and had bandaged the torn flesh as well as he
was able; and now, very gently, but without
any skill, he was fumbling at the girl&rsquo;s breast.</p>

<p>Jean made an effort to speak but his lips
made no intelligible sounds at first. The
servant came running to him joyfully nevertheless.
&ldquo;Signorino! You are better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kind brown eyes smiled through the
dimness of their pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Vincenzo ... well done. She
... she&rsquo;s not dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, signorino&mdash;at least&mdash;I am not sure,&rdquo;
the man faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wound is near the heart, is it not?
Lay her down here beside me and I will keep
it closed with my hand,&rdquo; Jean said faintly.
&ldquo;Lift her and lay her down here in the hollow
of my unhurt arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No ... no!&rdquo; she had cried. &ldquo;Together.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
No other man should touch her&mdash;if she died
it must be in his arms. How still she was,
how little warmth of life was there to cherish,
how small a fluttering of the dear heart under
his hand&rsquo;s pressure....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go now and get help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincenzo made no answer, but his eyes
were like those of a faithful dog, anguished,
appealing, and he knelt to kiss the poor
fingers that had been bruised under that cruel
heel before he went out of the room.</p>

<p>Very softly he closed and locked the door, and
then stood for a while in the close darkness of
the passage, listening. That devil&mdash;he wanted
them to die&mdash;suppose he should be lurking
somewhere about the house, waiting for the
servant to go that he might finish his work.</p>

<p>The Tor di Rocca were hard and swift and
cruel as steel. That Duchess Veronica, who
had brought her husband the other woman&rsquo;s
severed head, wrapped in fine linen of her own
weaving, as a New Year&rsquo;s gift!&mdash;she had been
one of them. Then there had lived one Filippo
who kept his younger brother chained up to
the wall of some inner room of his Florentine
palace for seventeen years, until, at last, a
serving-man dared to go and tell of the sound
of blows in the night hours, the moaning,
the clank of a chain, and the people broke in,
and hanged the Prince from the wrought-iron
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fanale</i> outside his own gate.</p>

<p>Vincenzo knew of all these old, past horrors;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the Florentines had made ballads of them,
and sang them in the streets, and one might
buy &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">L&rsquo;Assassina</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Fratello del
Principe</i>,&rdquo; printed on little sheets of coarse
paper, on the stalls in the Mercato, for one
soldo. So, though the house was very still,
the little man drew his long knife and read
the motto scratched on the blade before he
climbed the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non ti fidar a me se il cor ti manca.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurriedly he passed through every room,
but there was no one there, and so he ran out
into the dripping green wilderness of torn
leaves and storm-tossed, drenched blossoms,
and up the lane, between the high walls of the
olive orchards, to the town.</p>

<p>Don Filippo was really gone, and he was
waiting now on the platform of the Albano
station for the train that should take him
back to Rome. He was not, however, presenting
the spectacle of the murderer fleeing
from his crime. He was quite calm. The
heat and cruelty of the Tor di Rocca blood
flared in him, but it burned with no steady
flame. He had not the tenacity of his forefathers;
and so, though he might kill his
brother, he would not care to torment him
during long years. Hate palled on him as
quickly as love. He was content to leave
the lives of Jean Avenel and of Olive on the
knees of the gods.</p>

<p>There was no pity, no tenderness in him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
be stirred by the remembrance of blue eyes
dilated with fear, of loosened brown hair, of
the small thing that had lain in a huddled
heap at his feet, and he was not afraid of any
consequences affecting him. In Italy the plea
of jealousy covers a multitude of sins, and he
was sure that a jury would acquit him if he
were charged with murder.</p>

<p>How many hundred years had passed since
Pilate had called for water to wash his hands!
Filippo&mdash;reminded in some way of the Roman
governor&mdash;felt that same need. His hands
were not clean&mdash;there was dust on them&mdash;and
it seemed that the one thing that really
might clog his thoughts and tarnish them
later on was the dust on a frilled cushion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>


<p>To some men their world is most precious when
their arms may compass it. These are the
great lovers. It seemed to Jean now that it
mattered little whether this grey hour of rain
and silence preluded life or death. Presently
they would come to the edge of the
stream called Lethe, and then he, making a
cup of his hands, would give the woman he
loved to drink of the waters of forgetfulness,
and all remembrance of loneliness and tears,
and of the pain that ached now in his side
and in her shot breast would pass away.</p>

<p>He looked down from a great height and
saw:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&ldquo;<i>the curled moon</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Was like a little feather</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fluttering far down the gulf;</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the round world, a caught fly, wrapped
in a web of clouds, hung by a slender thread
of some huge spider&rsquo;s spinning. There was
a dark mark upon it that spread and reddened
until it seemed to be a stain of blood on a
woman&rsquo;s breast. She had been pale, but the
colour had come again when he had kissed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
her. It was gone now. Was it all in the red
that oozed between his fingers?</p>

<p>In the twilight of his senses stray thoughts
fluttered and passed like white moths. Was
that the roar of voices? The hall was full and
they wanted him, but he could not play again.
Love was best. He would stay in the garden
with Olive.</p>

<p>What were they asking for? A nocturne&mdash;yes;
it was getting dark, and the sea was
rising&mdash;that was the sound of the sea.</p>

<p class="padtop">The doctor Vincenzo had brought in rose
from his knees and stood thoughtfully wiping
his hands on a piece of lint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must see about extracting the bullets
later on. One went clean through his arm
and so has saved us the trouble. As to her&mdash;I
am not sure&mdash;but I think the injury may
not be so serious as it now appears. She
was evidently stunned. She must have struck
her head against the table in falling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can they be moved?&rdquo; the servant asked
anxiously. &ldquo;My master would not care to
stay on here. Can you take them into your
house, and&mdash;and not say anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated. He was a bald, grey-whiskered
man, fat and flaccid. His cuffs
were frayed and there were wine-stains on his
shabby clothes. He was very poor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should inform the authorities,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think that is necessary. It
would be worth your while not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean&rsquo;s fur coat had been thrown across a
chair. The doctor eyed it carefully. It was
worth more lire than he had ever possessed at
one time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The vineyard across
the lane is mine. We can go to my house that
way and take them through the gate without
ever coming out on to the road. I will go
and tell my housekeeper to get the rooms
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincenzo&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;I will go in
the car to-night to fetch the master&rsquo;s brother.
He is very rich. It will be worth your while,&rdquo;
he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be heavy to carry. Shall we be
able to do it alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Via!</em>&rdquo; cried the little man. &ldquo;I am very
strong. Go now and come back soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the other had left the room he crouched
down again on the floor at Jean&rsquo;s feet.
&ldquo;Signorino! Signorino! Speak to me!
Look at me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no voice now, nor any that
answered.</p>

<p class="padtop">For a long while, it seemed, Jean was a spent
swimmer, struggling to reach a distant shore.
The cruel cross-currents drew him, great
waves buffeted him, and the worst of it was
they were hot. All the sea was bubbling and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
boiling about him, and the sound in his ears
was like the roar of steam. There were
creatures in the water, too; octopi, such as
he had seen caught in nets by the Venetian
fishermen and flung on the yellow sands of
the Lido. He saw their tentacles flickering
in the green curled edges of each wave that
threatened to beat him down into the depths.</p>

<p>Vincenzo kept them off. He was always
there, sitting by the door, and when he was
called he came running to his master&rsquo;s bedside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she? Don&rsquo;t let her be drowned!
Don&rsquo;t let the octopi get her! Vincenzo!
Vincenzo!&rdquo; he cried, and the good fellow tried
to reassure him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sia benedetto</i>, signorino! They shall not
have her. I will cut them in pieces with my
knife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter? I am quite well.
Is it only the tyre? There is Orvieto, and
the sun just risen. Is it still raining?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, signorino. The sun shines and it
has not rained for days. It will soon be
May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very slowly the tide of feverish dreams
ebbed, and Jean became aware of the iris
pattern on the curtains of the bed; of the ray
of sunlight that danced every morning on the
ceiling and passed away; of the old woman
who gave him his medicine. She was kind,
and he liked to see her sitting sewing by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
lamplight, and to watch her distorted shadow
looming gigantic in an angle of the wall.
Hilaire was there too, but sometimes he was
called away, and then Jean would hear his
uneven step going to and fro across an uncarpeted
floor, and the sound of hushed voices
in the next room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hilaire, is&mdash;is it all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, do not be afraid. Get well,&rdquo; the
elder man answered, but Jean still lay with his
face turned to the wall. He was afraid. The
longing to see Olive, to hold her once more
in his arms, burned within him. He moved
restlessly and laid his clenched hands together
on the half-healed wound in his side.</p>

<p>One night he slept soundly, dreamlessly, as a
child sleeps, and woke at dawn. He raised
himself on his elbow in the bed and looked
about him, and Vincenzo came to him at once
and asked him what he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and leave me alone
for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The green painted window-shutter was unfastened,
and it swung open in the little wind
that had sprung up. Jean saw the morning
star shining, and the widening rift of pale gold
in the grey sky above the hills. He heard
the stirring of awakened life. Birds fluttered
in the laurels. A boy was singing as he went
to his work among the vines by the lake
side:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ho da dirti tante cose.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>

It seemed to Jean that he too had many
things to say to the woman he loved. He
called to her faintly, in a weak, hoarse voice:
&ldquo;Olive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a while he heard her answering him
from the next room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean! Oh, Jean!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lay still, smiling.</p>

<p class="center xlrgfont">AN OUTCAST OF THE ISLANDS</p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo.</i>, <i>cloth</i>, <b>6s.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="smlfont">&ldquo;Subject to the qualifications thus disposed of (<i>vide</i> first part of notice),
&lsquo;An Outcast of the Islands&rsquo; is perhaps the finest piece of fiction that has been
published this year, as &lsquo;Almayer&rsquo;s Folly&rsquo; was one of the finest that was published
in 1895.... Surely this is real romance&mdash;the romance that is real.
Space forbids anything but the merest recapitulation of the other living
realities of Mr. Conrad&rsquo;s invention&mdash;of Lingard, of the inimitable Almayer,
the one-eyed Babalatchi, the Naturalist, of the pious Abdulla&mdash;all novel, all
authentic. Enough has been written to show Mr. Conrad&rsquo;s quality. He
imagines his scenes and their sequence like a master; he knows his individualities
and their hearts; he has a new and wonderful field in this East Indian
Novel of his.... Greatness is deliberately written; the present writer has
read and re-read his two books, and after putting this review aside for some
days to consider the discretion of it, the word still stands.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i></p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;This startling, unique, splendid book.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="sig">Mr. <span class="smcap">T. P. O&rsquo;Connor</span>, M.P.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="smlfont">&ldquo;This is a decidedly powerful story of an uncommon type, and breaks fresh
ground in fiction.... All the leading characters in the book&mdash;Almayer, his
wife, his daughter, and Dain, the daughter&rsquo;s native lover&mdash;are well drawn, and
the parting between father and daughter has a pathetic naturalness about it,
unspoiled by straining after effect. There are, too, some admirably graphic
passages in the book. The approach of a monsoon is most effectively
described.... The name of Mr. Joseph Conrad is new to us, but it appears
to us as if he might become the Kipling of the Malay Archipelago.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spectator</i></p>

<p class="smlfont">The <i>Daily Graphic</i> says: &ldquo;&lsquo;The Beetle&rsquo;
is the kind of book which you put down
only for the purpose of turning up the gas

is standing behind your chair, and it is a
book which no one will put down until
finished except for the reason above described.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smlfont">The <i>Speaker</i> says: &ldquo;A story of the most
terrific kind is duly recorded in this extremely
powerful book. The skill with which
its fantastic horrors are presented to us is
undeniable.&rdquo;</p>
